            "1 Facebook has a 100-person engineering team that helps advertisers build tools and infrastructure\n",
            "Stories about Facebook’s  advertising business tend to focus on the big numbers — its billions of users, millions of advertisers or its enormous lead over any competitor that’s not named Google. But Facebook says that one of its success stories in recent years involves a relatively small group of engineers — in fact, originally it was just one engineer, Vatsal Mehta, who serves as Facebook’s director of solutions engineering and now leads a team of more than 100 people. That team works with advertisers to build the technology and infrastructure needed to run more effective campaigns on Facebook, often on top of Facebook’s APIs. Mehta said that when he first started working on this in 2010, it was a very different landscape, both for mobile (where BlackBerry was still a major player) and for Facebook (which hadn’t even introduced advertising into the News Feed). This was right as the company was trying to shift in a big way toward mobile, and advertisers were still trying to wrap their heads around the change: “For example, travel companies didn’t have teams set up to reach consumers with mobile advertising. We knew that we needed to invest in helping businesses build infrastructure to power their mobile advertising, so I started a team that could help businesses in this sort of bespoke way,” Mehta added. You’d expect any digital media business to offer some degree of technical support to its biggest advertisers, but the solutions engineering team is actually building products. For example, it was involved in creating Facebook’s dynamic ads format (where ads show different products to different users based on their activities and interests). Mehta said dynamic ads were first inspired by the complaints of an advertiser he was meeting with in Hamburg, Germany, and he then worked with the Facebook Ads team to create a prototype, eventually leading to a more polished product and broader availability. It’s probably safe to say that not every client meeting leads to a new ad format — sometimes Mehta’s team is just helping advertisers understand how to use their existing tools in a more effective way. But that other option, working with the rest of Facebook to build something new, is also on the table.  To give me a better sense of what the team actually does, Facebook connected me with Anthony Marino, chief marketing officer at online thrift store thredUP. Marino said that when his company started talking with Facebook’s solution engineering team in 2016, there was a big challenge: How to use ads to highlight thredUP’s constantly changing inventory. “On thredUP, the site is practically remade every hour as thousands and thousands of new items are added,” he said. “We looked at that flow of product, of apparel, and it was like being a news site … We had to figure out a way to automate the process of, okay, once we capture and the attributes and qualities of different items of clothing, how do we get them in front of the right person?” To enable that, Facebook worked with thredUP to launch dynamic ads that were connected to thredUP’s real-time product catalog. The system uses machine learning to further improve the targeting; for example, showing users different types of ads at different times of day. “The first thing is, Facebook puts the right people in the room,” Marino said. He recounted working with Facebook to create “new ad products, new data pipelines” between the two systems, and he said, “There were product people, there were operations people in the room. We were able to really integrate at the data integration, at the business process level.” Did this actually lead thredUP to buy more ads on Facebook? The companies didn’t share numbers about the company’s ad spending, but part of the process involved shifting thredUP from Criteo retargeting to Facebook dynamic ads, and Marino told me, “Working with the solutions engineering team at Facebook enabled us to spend our dollars more efficiently, so that we could amp our marketing budget and drive more new customers to thredUP.com.” The team has worked with other customers, including Michael Kors, Edmunds, The New York Times, Gilt and Zynga. It also works with the companies that offer ad-buying tools on top of Facebook, like Smartly, Kenshoo, Marin Software, Adobe, Social Code and Nanigans — and mobile gaming company Machine Zone said the Facebook ad-buying platform it built with the solution engineering team’s help was so successful that it’s launching a new business called Cognant. Facebook says that on average, clients working with the solutions engineering team see their return on ad spend improve by 100 percent.  Of course, while Facebook continues to do extraordinarily well financially, it’s been battered in public perception as the government scrutinizes the role it may have played in spreading misinformation as part of Russia’s election interference efforts. On the ad side, Facebook has announced new transparency features like the ability to see every ad campaign from a given advertiser, and an archive of ads related to federal elections. When I brought this up, the company said these changes, and the broader political environment, haven’t really affected the day-to-day work of the solutions engineering team, which is much more in the trenches, helping advertisers do new things. As for what they’ll be up to in 2018, Mehta said: One area we’re increasingly spending time helping clients with is incorporating more machine learning into solutions and driving efficiency through technology. This includes building better optimization tools that help the client without them needing to adjust and turn nobs in the interface. We see this as a huge area of investment across our business over the next year.  \n",

            "2 Check now to see if you liked any Russian troll accounts on Facebook\n",
            "This fall saw ever-rising estimates of the number of people reached by Russian-backed troll accounts — just shy of 150 million at last count . Now the social network has at last released the tool it promised last month allowing users to see if they liked or followed one of the many pages or pieces of content put online during the sketchy attempt at mass manipulation. Far from shouting the availability of this tool from the rooftops, Facebook waited until the Friday before Christmas, a traditional dumping-ground for items companies would rather go unnoticed, and then stuck the tool deep in the help pages. Nice try, Facebook! To its credit, though, the tool is remarkably simple to use. Just go to this page and it should display any of the accounts created by Russia’s Internet Research Agency that you might have liked or followed. If you log into your Instagram account, it’ll show that info too. If you followed some of the shady accounts, it’ll look like this: If the box is empty, that doesn’t mean you weren’t exposed to the content in question, just that you didn’t engage with it. You may still very well be among the lucky 146 million. No doubt Facebook could tell you whether that’s the case or not, but the optics on telling people directly are pretty bad — everyone would take a screenshot and post it with the caption “WTF!” or “OMG Facebook is broken!” We look forward to similar tools from other major companies that have discovered attempts at election interference on their platforms.  \n",

            "3 Facebook and Universal Music Group’s new partnership will allow for user-gen videos with licensed music, new social features\n",
            "Facebook  today announced a first-of-its-kind licensing deal with Universal Music Group that will allow users across its properties – including Facebook, Instagram and Oculus – to use Universal Music in the videos they upload and share. The deal will also allow Facebook to introduce new “music-based products” across platforms, also including Messenger, the companies said. Deal terms were not disclosed, but the partnership represents the first time a major music company has licensed its catalog for videos and other social features across Facebook. It means that Facebook will be working with Universal Music Group to ensure that artists’ work is protected and compensated on Facebook and its platforms. This will be done in a variety of ways, we understand, including by Facebook obtaining rights to launch experimental social music features over time. “There is a magnetic relationship between music and community building. We are excited to bring that to life on Facebook, Instagram, Oculus and Messenger in partnership with UMG. Music lovers, artists and writers will all be right at home as we open up creativity, connection and innovation through music and video,” said Tamara Hrivnak, Head of Music Business Development and Partnerships at Facebook, in a statement. “Together, Facebook and UMG are creating a dynamic new model for collaboration between music companies and social platforms to advance the interests of recording artists and songwriters while enhancing the social experience of music for their fans,” added Michael Nash, Executive Vice President of Digital Strategy, Universal Music Group. “This partnership is an important first step demonstrating that innovation and fair compensation for music creators are mutually reinforcing – they thrive together. We look forward to Facebook becoming a significant contributor to a healthy ecosystem for music that will benefit artists, fans and all those who invest in bringing great music to the world.” The companies aren’t detailing what sort of “music-based” products they may have in the works as a result of this deal, but the move seems largely focused on helping artists better connect with fans – in particular by allowing fans to use their favorite music in their own videos, or by sharing their favorite songs. It will also give artists the option to connect and build their community with music in other ways. It’s easy to imagine how this deal could help Facebook further its video efforts, where it increased its focus this year with the debut of Facebook Watch – a dedicated portal for video. The partnership could also help Facebook challenge other tech companies that operate in the combined music/social space. This includes Spotify, which this year rolled out a new set of tools to help them manage their presence on the streaming service, track their releases, and connect with fans; as well as Musical.ly, which sold to Chinese social media giant Bytedance this year for >$800 million, and has a sizable and growing audience of young fans who create their own lip-sync music videos. The deal would also allow Facebook to fill out its newly launched “Sound Collection,” aimed at creators, with well-known songs. Universal Music Group already works with other companies, like Spotify and YouTube, so it’s not unprecedented for it to work with a social property. (Variety has the internal memo from UMG about the deal, but it doesn’t include more specifics than the press release – it’s mostly just cheerleading the partnership.) Facebook declined to share more information on its plans for new social features, when asked. The company may have plans to do similar partnership deals in the future, given its new ambitions. Those will likely be easier to obtain if it can prove out that it was able to boost music sales, merchandise or concert tickets by promoting Universal Music Group’s library.  \n",

            "4 Facebook will ditch Disputed Flags on fake news and display links to trustworthy articles instead\n",
            "Facebook  announced two changes today that it hopes will make it easier to staunch the spread of fake news. The first change is to the News Feed, where users will no longer see “Disputed Flags,” or red badges displayed under articles flagged by Facebook’s third-party fact-checkers. Instead, they will see Related Articles, or links to content from reputable publishers. The second change is a new initiative to help Facebook understand how people judge the accuracy of information based the news sources they use, which won’t result in any immediate changes to the News Feed, but is meant to help the company gauge how well its efforts to stop the spread of misinformation are working. Along with Google and Twitter, Facebook is currently under pressure by critics who say it hasn’t done enough to combat fake news on its platform, including articles by “troll farms” that disseminate misinformation to make a profit or sway public opinion on politics and other hot-button issues. The issue became more urgent during the presidential election and all three companies have been called to testify in congressional hearings over how their platforms were used by Russian-backed trolls to influence U.S. politics. Almost exactly one year ago, Facebook implemented several changes to fight fake news, including easier steps to report articles, partnerships with fact-checking organizations and features, like Disputed Flags, that alert people when they are about to read or share articles that have identified by fact-checkers as fake news. Facebook also started demoting fake news links, which it says usually mean they lose 80 percent of their traffic. In today’s announcement, Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons said Facebook decided to replace Disputed Flags with Related Articles because the red badges actually had the effect of reinforcing beliefs. “Academic research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply held beliefs—the opposite effect to what we intended,” Lyons wrote. “Related Articles, by contrast, are simply designed to give more context, which our research has shown is a more effective way to help people get to the facts. Indeed, we’ve found that when we show Related Articles next to a false news story, it leads to fewer shares than when the Disputed Flag is shown.” Facebook will now display Related Articles with links identified as “fake news” Launched in 2013, Related Articles are what Facebook calls the links it displays on News Feeds after users finish reading an article. Related Articles were originally created to boost engagement and prevent people’s News Feeds from being flooded with silly memes by directing them to content from reputable publishers instead. Then in April of this year, Facebook announced a test that showed Related Articles before articles about trending topics, with the intent of giving users “easier access to additional perspectives and information.” Another blog post written by the team leading Facebook’s efforts against fake news–product designer Jeff Smith, user experience researcher Grace Jackson and content strategist Seetha Raj–gives more insight into today’s announcement. Over the past year, the team says they visited different countries to conduct research into how misinformation spreads in different contexts and how people react to “designs meant to inform them that what they are reading is fake news.” As a result, they identified four major ways the Disputed Flags feature could be improved. First, the team wrote, Disputed Flags need to tell people immediately why fact-checkers dispute an article, because most users won’t bother clicking on links to additional information. Second, strong language or images like a red flag sometimes backfire by reinforcing beliefs, even if they are marked as false. Third, Facebook only applied Disputed Flags after two fact-checking organizations had determined it was false, but that meant it sometimes did not act quickly enough, especially in countries with very few fact-checkers. Finally, some of Facebook’s fact-checking partners rated articles on a scale (for example, “false,” “partly false,” “unproven” or “true”), so context and nuance was lost when a Disputed Flag was applied, especially on rare occasions when two organizations fact-checked the same article but came to different conclusions about its credibility. Displaying Related Articles before someone clicks on a link is meant to address all of those issues by making it easier to get context, requiring only one fact-checker’s review, working even for on articles that got different ratings and preventing the kind of reaction that might cause someone to dig in their heels about a belief, even if it is wrong. Furthermore, even though the new application of Related Articles doesn’t “meaningfully change” clickthrough rates, Facebook’s anti-fake news team says it leads to fewer shares. In a bid to increase transparency, users will also now see badges that identify which fact-checkers reviewed an article. “As some of the people behind this product, designing solutions that support news readers is a responsiblity we take seriously,” wrote Smith, Jackson and Raj. “We will continue working hard on these efforts by testing new treatments, improving existing treatments and collaborating with academic experts on this complicated misinformation problem.”  \n",

            "5 Revoice.me offers a simple way to let your blog and newsletter readers subscribe via Facebook Messenger\n",
            "If you publish a newsletter or blog, you’ll know that it’s a continuous battle to vie for readers’ attention. Even for subscribers, open rates for email are shockingly low, and RSS never did quite go mainstream. Meanwhile, delivering content via Facebook Pages has become more of a crapshoot than ever. Enter: Revoice.me, a new service that makes it easy to give readers (or listeners and viewers) the option to subscribe to your content — newsletter, blog, podcast or YouTube channel — via Facebook Messenger. Because, as we end 2017, messaging apps is where a significant proportion of your audience is at. Or so the thinking goes. Built by the same startup behind Hooks (the app that lets you get a push notification for just about anything), Revoice.me launched in stealth mode about three months ago, but is now outing its wares more publicly after becoming a ‘Certified Partner’ of marketing platform HubSpot. “We found that it is really hard to deliver our content, even to people who have opt-in to it, and we have a lot of friends in the industry saying the same even for their personal newsletters, podcasts, etc.,” says Revoice.me co -founder Oleg Kozynenko. “Meanwhile, it turns out that Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps are an amazing channel for content delivery, with great CTR (our users get around 75-80 percent) and massive adoption”. An example of a Revoice.me landing page However, because Messenger is a relatively new publishing channel, Kozynenko argues that there aren’t tools that fit the workflow of marketers and creators. “Existing players like ChatFuel or ManyChat focus on the bot experience, leaving content creators behind,” he says. “That’s where Revoice comes in, to make the process easy. With our automation tool you just tell us what content you have or where to get it, and we will make it look good on messaging apps”. To add Facebook Messenger subscription as an option for your newsletter, blog, podcast or YouTube channel, you will first need a Facebook Page for your brand. Then it’s just a case of signing up to Revoice — which has free and paid plans, depending on if you require CRM integration and additional pro features — and linking it to your Facebook Page account. After doing so, you point Revoice to your content sources, such as your email newsletter, and the service takes care of the rest, automatically pushing new content to Messenger. You’re given a ‘subscribe to Messenger’ widget to post to your blog and your own ‘subscribe to Messenger’ landing page (you can view mine here). Revoice also has similar support for Chrome, Slack and Telegram, too. “Revoice is free to use with our signature. No limits on messages or subscribers. We charge $29 [per month] for integrations with CRMs and for removing our brand mentions,” adds Kozynenko.  \n",

            "As Facebook  looks to keep its VR dream moving, the company is opening its nascent social VR platform to run on headsets that the company doesn’t build. Today, a VR exec at the company announced that Facebook Spaces would be gaining support to run on the competing HTC Vive headset. The move opens up the platform to a wider audience inside what is still a very tight niche of users. Users on both the Oculus and HTC headsets will be able to meet up in the cross-platform app, where they can chat, watch videos, draw, play games and go on virtual trips. Facebook has made hefty investments into virtual reality under the Oculus brand, but Spaces is one of the few high-end virtual reality plays that bears Facebook’s name. Announced at F8 this past year, the app is still in beta, but open to anyone with an Oculus Rift headset or now the HTC Vive. Facebook Spaces is still lacking support for Sony’s PlayStation VR headset. Sony announced recently that they’ve moved more than 2 million headsets in just over a year.  \n",

            "7 Facebook has new tools to prevent unwanted friend requests and messages\n",
            "Facebook,  like every social media platform, has issues with harassment and bullying. In order to prevent certain types of harassment, Facebook is introducing some new features to help prevent unwanted friend requests and messages. “We’ve heard stories from people who have blocked someone only to encounter the same harasser using a different account,” Facebook Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis wrote on Facebook’s blog. “In order to help prevent those bad encounters, we are building on existing features that prevent fake and inauthentic accounts on Facebook.” Let’s say you block someone and then that person decides to create another account so they can contact you. With these new tools in place, Facebook is aiming to recognize when someone does that and prevent them from sending a message or friend request to you. Facebook is using signals, like IP addresses, to recognize when someone has created a fake or inauthentic account. “The person who blocked the original account is in control, and must initiate contact with the new account in order for them to interact normally,” Davis wrote. Facebook has also released a feature to ignore conversations, which disables notifications from the conversation and moves the conversation into your filtered messages folder. Once in the filtered messages folder, you can read the conversation without the sender being able to know if you’ve read it. This is currently available for one-on-one messages and will be available for group messages soon, according to the blog post. Facebook says it has worked with experts in a variety of fields to offer safety resources for people on Facebook. In the blog post, Davis said the company has worked with the National Network to End Domestic Violence and worked to learn more about the experiences of journalists on Facebook. Earlier this month, Facebook unveiled its own internal policies around harassment and bullying. Facebook also outlined its investigation process in response to reports of harassment or bullying.  \n",

            "Facebook  wants to make sure you know about and control the photos of you people upload, even if they don’t tag you. So today, Facebook launched a new facial recognition feature called Photo Review that will alert you when your face shows up in newly posted photos so you can tag yourself, leave it be, ask the uploader to take the photo down, or report it to Facebook. The feature should give people confidence that there aren’t pics of them floating around Facebook that they could see but just don’t know about. It could also help thwart impersonation. But Facebook tells me it has no plans to use facial recognition to enhance ad targeting or content relevancy sorting, like showing you more News Feed posts from friends who post untagged photos of you or ads related to locations where you appear in untagged photos. If you’re in someone’s profile photo which is always public, you’ll always be notified. For other photos, you’ll only get notified if you’re in the audience for that photo so as to protect the uploader’s privacy and not alert you about photos you’re not allowed to see. A Photo Review section of the profile will keep track of all your untagged but recognized photos. Facebook’s applied machine learning product manager Nipun Mather tells me the feature is designed to give people more control, make them feel safer, and provide opportunities for nostalgia.  Facebook is also adding a new overarching photo and video facial recognition opt out privacy setting that will delete its face template of you and deactivate the new Photo Review feature as well as the old Tag Suggestions that used facial recognition to speed up tagging when friends posted a photo of you. These will all roll out everywhere over the next few weeks except in Europe and Canada where privacy laws prohibit Facebook’s facial recognition tech. Facebook is also using the feature to assist the vision impaired. Now Facebook’s machine vision-powered feature that describes what’s in a photo will also read aloud the names of untagged friends. “Over time our goal is to make these features available everywhere . . . but right now we’re focusing on markets where tag suggestions are available” says Facebook’s Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman. While Tag Suggestions might be seen as weakening privacy, Photo Review could be perceived as enhancing it and might get a pass from regulators. Whether it’s an unauthorizied photo of you that you want taken off Facebook, an embarrassing pic you don’t want tagged but want to monitor comments on, or someone trying to pretend to be you, Photo Review gives people more visibility into how their likeness is used.  \n",

In August 2016 the social networking giant caused massive controversy when its messaging platform WhatsApp announced a privacy U-turn — saying it would shortly begin sharing user data with its parent, Facebook, and Facebook’s network of companies, despite the founder’s prior publicly stated stance that user privacy would never be compromised as a result of the Facebook acquisition. WhatsApp’s founder, Jan Koum, had also assured users that ads would not be added to the platform. However the data-sharing arrangement with Facebook included “ad-targeting purposes” among its listed reasons. Users were offered an opt-out, but only a time-limited one — which also required they actively read through terms & conditions to find and uncheck a default-checked box to prevent information such as their mobile phone number being shared with Facebook for ad targeting (shared phone numbers enabling the company to link a user’s Facebook profile and activity with their WhatsApp account). The company’s subsequent teeing up of a monetization strategy for WhatsApp, via the forthcoming launch of business accounts, likely explains its push to link users of the end-to-end encrypted messaging platform with Facebook users, where the same people have likely engaged in far more public digital activity — such as liking pages, searching for content, and making posts and comments that Facebook is able to read. And that’s how a platform giant which owns multiple social networks is able to circumvent the privacy firewall provided by e2e encryption to still be able to perform ad-targeting. (Facebook doesn’t need to read your WhatsApp messages because it has a granular profile of who you are, based on your multi-years of Facebook activity… And while business accounts don’t constitute literal ‘display ads’, in the traditional sense, they clearly open up ample targeting opportunities for Facebook to engineer once it links all its user profiling data.) In May this year Facebook was fined $122M by the European Commission for providing “incorrect or misleading” information at the time of its 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp — when it had claimed it could not automatically match user accounts between its own platform and WhatsApp. And then three years later was doing exactly that. In the European Union another twist to this story is that Facebook’s data transfers between WhatsApp and Facebook for ads/product purposes were quickly suspended — the CNIL confirms in its notice that Facebook told it the data of its 10M French users have never been processed for targeted advertising purposes — after local regulators intervened, and objected publicly that Facebook had not provided users with enough information about what it planned to do with their data, nor secured “valid consent” to share their information. Another bone of contention was over the opt-out being time-limited to just a 30-day window. However the CNIL’s intervention now is based on a continued investigation of the data transfers covering the two other areas Facebook claimed it would be using the WhatsApp user data for — namely security and “evaluation and improvement of services” (aka business intelligence). And while the regulator seems satisfied that security is a valid and legal reason to transfer the data — writing that “it seems to be essential to the efficient functioning of the application” — business intelligence is another matter, with CNIL noting the purpose here “aims at improving performances and optimizing the use of the application through the analysis of its users’ behavior”. “The chair of the CNIL considered that the data transfer from WhatsApp to Facebook Inc. for this ‘business intelligence’ purpose is not based on the legal basis required by the Data Protection Act for any processing,” it continues. “In particular, neither the users’ consent nor the legitimate interest of WhatsApp can be used as arguments in this case.” The watchdog asserts that user consent is “not validly collected” because it is neither specified for this purpose (rather it is only listed as processing “in general”); it also says it is not ‘free’ — in the sense of users being able to refuse the transfer; with the only option if they do not agree being to uninstall the application. “On the other hand, the company WhatsApp cannot claim a legitimate interest to massively transfer data to the company Facebook Inc. insofar as this transfer does not provide adequate guarantees allowing to preserve the interest or the fundamental freedoms of users since there is no mechanism whereby they can refuse it while continuing to use the application,” it adds. Reached for comment a Facebook spokesperson provided the following statement: Privacy is incredibly important to WhatsApp. It’s why we collect very little data, and encrypt every message. We will continue to work with the CNIL to ensure users understand what information we collect, as well as how it’s used. And we’re committed to resolving the different, and at times conflicting concerns, we’ve heard from European Data Protection Authorities with a common EU approach before the General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in May 2018. The spokesperson failed to respond to specific questions we put to it about its WhatsApp data transfer activity in Europe. But did confirm that WhatsApp-Facebook data transfers for product/ads remain paused across the region. In its formal notice to Facebook, the French watchdog sharply criticizes the company for failing to co-operate with its investigation — writing that its departments “repeatedly asked” WhatsApp to provide a sample of the French users’ data transferred to Facebook Inc only to be told that “it could not supply the sample requested by the CNIL since, as it is located in the United States, it considers that it is only subject to the legislation of this country”. “The CNIL, which is competent the moment an operator processes data in France, was therefore unable to examine the full extent of the compliance of the processing implemented by the company with the Data Protection Act because of the violation of its obligation to cooperate with the Commission under Article 21 of the Act,” it writes. It also criticizes WhatsApp for “insufficiently” co-operating with its investigation — saying it made it difficult to determine how data was being processed. The CNIL adds that it decided to make the formal notice public in order to raise awareness of the “massive data transfer from WhatsApp to Facebook Inc and thus to alert to the need for individuals concerned to keep their data under control”. It also makes a point of emphasizing that the data transfer has increased in the amount of information the company has at its disposal — “including information about individuals who have not registered for its social network”. (The CNIL has previously ordered Facebook to stop tracking non-users.)  \n",

            "10 Government requests for Facebook user data continue to increase worldwide\n",
            "Facebook  continues to see increased requests for user data from governments worldwide, according to its latest transparency report. The social network first introduced the reports, which give raw figures on data requests and data granted, in 2013 to help increase visibility on government behavior. Facebook is limited on what information it can share, but sheer numbers show requests hit 78,890 in the first half of 2017, an increase of 33 percent year-on-year and 23 percent on the previous six-month period. The U.S., India, UK, Germany and France were the most active in making data requests, accounting for 41 percent, 12 percent, nine percent, seven percent and six percent of the numbers, respectively. Each of those country’s government had more than 50 percent of requests granted, with the U.S. (85 percent), UK (90 percent) and France (74 percent) notable for higher rates. The amount of data restricted by Facebook to governments also shot up in the first half of 2017 to reach 28,036, up from 6,944 the previous quarter and 9,666 one year prior. However, much of that figure can be traced back to a tragic shooting at a school in Mexico, which resulted in Facebook restricting access to 20,506 pieces of content. Despite the disclosures there remains plenty that Facebook can’t say, particularly around the nature and intention of data requests from governments. That’s particularly true in the U.S.. “Fifty-seven percent of the data requests we received from law enforcement in the U.S. contained a non-disclosure order that prohibited us from notifying the user, up from 50 percent in our last report,” Facebook Deputy General Counsel Chris Sonderby wrote in a blog post.  Facebook’s U.S. government score for the first half of 2017 Beyond state-related communication, Facebook has also introduced more accountability on IP-related content requests for the first time. More than 200,000 copyright requests were made related to Facebook content, with 68 percent actioned on and 1.8 million pieces of content “actioned.” Some 70,000 requests for copyright came to Instagram, with 685,000 pieces of content removed. Over 110,000 pieces of Facebook content were removed for trademark infringement, with over 37,000 removed from Instagram. The numbers are quite revealing when it comes to claims of counterfeits. Facebook said 217,265 of content on its social network were removed after it acted on 81 percent of 14,279 claims in the first half of the year. On Instagram, it took action against 108,094 posts following 10,231 counterfeit claims. Counterfeit claims against Instagram content rose steadily in the first half of 2017, with June’s complaint number (2,191 reports) higher than the number of complaints filed for Facebook in April and close to other months. Still, the actual number of content that was taken action against was lower on Instagram than Facebook, but it is a glimpse of the rise of Instagram as a medium of influence and importance even if Facebook remains the larger social network in terms of content.  \n",

            "11 Facebook is clamping down on posts that shamelessly beg for your engagement\n",
            "A lot of crap gets shared on Facebook,  but coming soon the volume may be a little less after Facebook made a move to penalize content that shamelessly begs people for engagement. The social network giant said today that it will penalize Page owners and people who resort to “engagement bait,” which means posts that encourage users to like, comment or tag people in the comments section in order to gain wider visibility of their content. The incentives — such as “Share with friends to win a free trip” or “Like if you’re an Aries” — gets content shared through engagement, ultimately helping the post, and the Page owner/author, grow its reach as users interact and it shows up on their friends’ Newsfeeds. Not so now. A new tweak to the Newsfeed algorithm will mean “stricter demotions” for Pages, and/or individual, who adopt engagement bait tactics. Starting in a couple of weeks, offenders will have the total reach on all of their posts reduced if their content is begging or baiting users to interact. As you’d expect, serial offenders will be hit hardest. But, Facebook is extending an olive branch and — initially, at least — engagement baiters can earn their original reach back with good behavior, i.e. less of the sludge and ‘better’ content all round.  Three examples of “engagement baiting” shared by Facebook Facebook did specify that there are some exceptions to this clampdown, and that includes examples like a missing child report, raising money for a cause, or asking for travel tips, to quote the company directly. The crackdown itself is led by a machine learning model that the social network said has been fed “hundreds of thousands of posts” to detect different kinds of engagement bait. This push to close down some of the spammier types of content follows a clampdown on sites with crappy web experiences — for example those caked in advertising — and moves to weed out clickbait in multiple languages. Facebook is, of course, still answering tougher question about the overall impact that its service is having on society across the world. In addition to explaining how Russian actors used the site to try to manipulate the U.S. general election and the UK’s Brexit vote, it is also being criticized from former executives who accuse it of “destroying how society works.”  \n",

            "12 Facebook pushes pre-roll ads on Watch as it stops subsidizing Live\n",
            "Everyone’s least favorite ads are coming to Facebook,  but six-second pre-rolls will only appear on original Watch tab videos you purposefully view and not in the News Feed. Facebook is embracing pre-rolls after years of shunning them as it tries to make payouts to video creators sustainable. Facebook’s head of video Fidji Simo tells TechCrunch that it will not renew direct subsidies to Live News Feed video broadcasters, confirming a Digiday report about it halting payments that included $50 million in contracts for 140 publishers and celebrities. “A lot of the deals … were always meant to be temporary,” says Simo. “We have been funding content for a while. We thought we’d launch a new type of format, and we tried to help publishers learn how to make that content work.” Facebook has a new set of deals to pay upfront for Watch shows, and that includes some recurring Live shows. But when asked if Live payments that funded content like BuzzFeed’s watermelon rubber band broadcast would be allowed to run out by early next year and not be renewed, Simo said “yes.”  Instead, Facebook will encourage Live News Feed video broadcasters to use branded content sponsorships and mid-roll ads. But videos must now be at least three minutes long to qualify and put the ad break at least one minute in, as opposed to the old rules that required videos to be at least 90 seconds with the mid-roll at least 20 seconds in. On a more positive note, Facebook will be upranking the News Feed presence of Watch original video shows that get consistent viewership, and it will display Shows in News Feed to users who follow the Show’s creator’s Page even if they haven’t viewed or subscribed to the Show itself yet. That could help Facebook develop a few flagship Shows, as nothing has quite broken out of the crowd of low quality, often unscripted content in Watch. Facebook has said it plans to fund fewer Shows with bigger budgets in the future. Facebook is trying to balance the delicate relationship between users, content publishers, advertisers and itself. The addition of pre-roll ads should delight publishers who want to ensure they get paid for their content even if users bail after a minute. It gives advertisers more flexibility, and could earn Facebook a boatload of money if Watch shows become popular. For the user, pre-roll ads will surely be annoying, but if someone purposefully goes to the Watch tab to view a specific video series, having to endure an ad feels pretty standard. Facebook would be smart to keep pre-rolls out of the News Feed where people serendipitously discover videos, but where having to view an ad first would ruin the breezy scrolling experience.  The big losers here, though, are the publishers who took Facebook’s Live and on-demand News Feed video subsidies, built up big teams of staffers to produce the expensive content and are now being shooed toward other monetization options that might not be mature enough to pay the bills. Before, these publishers just had to make entertaining video, and Facebook paid. Now, those videos must jam in sponsored content, or hold people’s attention for at least a minute before they can show an ad break. We could see video staff layoffs at publishers as a result. It’s a symptom of a larger news industry crisis, where publishers struggling to compensate for dropping display ad rates a few years ago were eager to suckle on added referral traffic from Facebook’s News Feed. But as I’ve written, publishers have become dumb content in Facebook’s smart pipes, reduced to ghostwriters Facebook can easily swap out. Publishers should have been concentrating on building an owned audience on their sites and email lists instead of becoming dependent on Facebook’s fickle mediated channel. Now Facebook is changing its video strategy from subsidizing News Feed videos more fit for journalism to longer, dramatic Watch Videos, while promoting more user-generated content from friends instead of articles from news outlets. Without the same massive team and profits, publishers may not be agile enough to gracefully adjust. And that’s why when Facebook dangles its next gift of virality, publishers should stay skeptical and focus on their long-term strategy rather than jumping through the new hoop.

            "Khosla-backed one drop blood test startup Genalyte has hired former Facebook exec Kevin Lo as president of the company. Lo comes to Genalyte  after leading “connectivity efforts” at Facebook “for the four billion people not online, and the 1.5B under-served who use the Internet at ‘2G’ speeds,” according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, Lo worked for Google where he headed up Google Fiber. So why jump into medicine after working on connecting the world? “We are at a critical juncture where technology and innovation are driving fundamental changes within our healthcare industry,” said Lo. “Genalyte is poised to lead a revolution in real time diagnostics—one that creates better treatment and patient outcomes.” Genalyte leverages lab-on-a-chip technology it says can run through up to 128 different tests on a single finger prick of blood in under 15 minutes using what it calls its Maverick Detection Platform. The San Diego-based startup’s proprietary silicon chip contains arrays of photonic microring sensors to detect diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and has so far raised nearly $92 million in venture funding. The startup hopes to use this technology in an outpatient setting, pending FDA approval. “We are thrilled to welcome Kevin to our leadership team at a moment of incredible momentum for the company,” Genalyte CEO Cary Gunn said in a statement. “Kevin’s unique expertise and experience working with some of the world’s most groundbreaking companies will help guide Genalyte as the company begins this next important chapter in diagnostic innovation.”  \n",

            "14 Click-to-WhatsApp messaging buttons are now rolling out in Facebook ads\n",
            "WhatsApp  has always said that it has no plans to put ads into its own app, but this is not stopping Facebook, which now owns WhatsApp, from figuring out other ways of monetizing the hugely popular messaging service, which has around 1 billion daily users. Today, Facebook  is launching a new ad unit that will let businesses create a link between the two platforms: advertisers can now include a button on their ads so that people can call or message via WhatsApp with the click of a button. We reported early sightings of the feature in test mode earlier this year.  Now, Facebook has confirmed to us that it’s rolling this out gradually, starting first with North and South America, Africa, Australia and most of Asia. You might notice that Europe is not included in the list, and wonder if that might relate to news that Facebook last year had to pause efforts to share data between the two platforms when it was deemed to violate data protection laws. From what we understand, the plan is to introduce Europe at a later date, but Facebook is going to first observe how the feature is used elsewhere, and is also still working through questions from outside the company about how WhatsApp and Facebook will work together. (Those outside the company may well include consumers, but also regulators.) The new feature getting announced today, more generally, follows on from some bigger developments for how WhatsApp is already being used by businesses. Facebook tells us that more than 1 million Facebook Pages already include WhatsApp numbers in their posts each month, which implies that there is already a pipeline between the two companies being used by businesses more informally to connect with customers more directly. Anecdotally, I’ve heard that in some developing markets, businesses are using their WhatsApp and Facebook pages as their primary points of contact for users, so this would make some sense to expand for Facebook, as the new White and Yellow Pages, respectively. “Many people already use WhatsApp to communicate with small businesses. It’s a fast, convenient way to stay in touch,” said Pancham Gajjar, product marketing manager, Facebook, in a statement. “By adding a click-to-WhatsApp button to Facebook ads, businesses can now make it even easier for people to learn about their products, set up an appointment or use their service.” The other trend to note here is that WhatsApp has been working on a way of creating more specific business accounts for some time now. Most recently, it’s posted some more information on its help pages about how business accounts will be verified, confirmed or unconfirmed — although it has yet to roll out any specific products or pricing tiers that speak to these three statuses. The new button ad-unit is also similar to the click-to-Messenger ads that Facebook previously rolled out. “That format was the first ad product to explicitly link activity on Facebook with activity on Messenger, and it was followed by other ad formats on Messenger itself,” said eMarketer principal analyst Debbie Williamson. “It seems that Facebook is following a similar strategy for WhatsApp, starting with click-to-WhatsApp ads on Facebook, and presumably eventually rolling out ads on WhatsApp itself.” (Which really would be a track back from WhatsApp’s mission statement.) For now, Facebook does not have plans to add the WhatsApp button integration to regular consumer services, although you can see the potential for putting the links in, say, Pages where users want to offer a contact address, or in the Marketplace next to items that are being sold, or even in job listings. “We recently started testing different ways for a Facebook Page to point people to their WhatsApp presence from the Page itself,” a spokesperson said, “but don’t have any more details to share on that right now.” Updated with comment from eMarketer.  \n",

            "15 Facebook’s Brexit probe unearths three Russian-bought “immigration” ads\n",
            "Facebook  has provided more details about the extent of Russian digital interference related to the UK’s Brexit vote last year. Last month the social media giant confirmed that Russian agents had used its platform to try to interfere in the UK’s referendum on EU membership — but said it had not found “significant coordination of ad buys or political misinformation targeting the Brexit vote”. Today’s findings apparently bear out that conclusion, with Facebook claiming it’s unearthed just three ads and less than $1 spent. The Brexit related Russian-backed ads ran for four days in May, ahead of the UK’s June referendum vote, and apparently garnered around 200 views on Facebook. It says the ads targeted both UK and US audiences — and “concerned immigration”, rather than being explicitly about the UK’s EU referendum vote. Which appears to be in line with the strategy Kremlin agents have deployed in the US, where Russian-bought ads have targeted all sorts of socially divisive issues in an apparent attempt to drive different groups and communities further apart. The Brexit-related ads were paid for by the same Russian-backed 470 accounts that it previously revealed spent ~$100,000, between June 2016 and May 2017, to run more than 3,000 ads targeting US users. And Facebook linked these accounts to Russia as a consequence of its investigation into Kremlin interference in the wake of the 2016 US presidential election. For the Brexit audit, it’s worth noting that Facebook appears to have only looked at identified Internet Research Agency (IRA) pages or account profiles — IRA being the previously unmasked Russian troll-farm — so there could be scope for other Russian-backed accounts to have bought ads intending to meddle with Brexit without Facebook realizing it. (Although given the levels of ad buys by IRA accounts targeting US Facebook users it’s perhaps unlikely there’s a second layer to the Russian political dis-ops campaign. Albeit still possible.) It also does not look like Facebook has attempted to measure and quantify non-paid Brexit-related disinformation posts by Russian-backed accounts — since it’s only talking in terms of “funded advertisements”. We’ve asked and will update this post with any response. Update: TechCrunch understands that since the scope of the Electoral Commission enquiry relates to activity funded by Russia, Facebook has — thus far — limited its Brexit scrutiny to ad buys. (Thereby making its scrutiny pretty limited.) We’ve also asked Facebook to share the three Russian-bought “immigration” ads, and to confirm whether they were anti-immigration in sentiment. So far the company has provided us with the following extract from a letter to the Electoral Commission as commentary on its findings: We strongly support the Commission’s efforts to regulate and enforce political campaign finance rules in the United Kingdom, and we take the Commission’s request very seriously. Further to your request, we have examined whether any of the identified Internet Research Agency (IRA) pages or account profiles funded advertisements to audiences in the United Kingdom during the regulated period for the EU Referendum. We have determined that these accounts associated with the IRA spent a small amount of money ($0.97) on advertisements that delivered to UK audiences during that time. This amount resulted in three advertisements (each of which were also targeted to US audiences and concerned immigration, not the EU referendum) delivering approximately 200 impressions to UK viewers over four days in May 2016. An Electoral Commission spokesperson we contacted for a response emphasized that its discussions with social media companies are at a very early stage. The spokesperson also confirmed that Google and Twitter have both also provided information in response to its request they do so, to feed its ongoing enquiry into whether the use of digital ads and bots on social media might break existing political campaigning rules. In a statement, the spokesperson added: “Facebook, Google and Twitter have responded to us. We welcome their cooperation. There is further work to be done with these companies in response to our request for details of campaign activity on their platforms funded from outside the UK. Following those discussions we will say more about our conclusions.” At the time of writing Twitter and Google had not responded to a request for details of the information they have passed to the Electoral Commission — which late last month Twitter said it would be providing “in the coming weeks”. Update: Twitter has now released its own Russian-bought Brexit ads report — saying it found six ads, and a total spend of just over $1k. (Though it also has not yet released any information about non-paid Russian-backed propaganda — i.e. bots and their free-to-post tweets — which were likely a lot more plentiful than actual ads.) A recent academic study of tweet data — looking at how political information diffused on Twitter’s platform specifically around the Brexit vote and the US election — identified more than 156,000 Russian accounts which mentioned #Brexit. The study also found Russian accounts posted almost 45,000 messages pertaining to the EU referendum in the 48 hours around the vote. Update: A Google spokesperson has now provided the following response — claiming not to have found any evidence of Russian disinformation ops. “We took a thorough look at our systems and found no evidence of this activity on our platform,” they told us. Social media’s still unaudited role in political campaigning looks set to remain in the domestic spotlight for the foreseeable future — as the Commission continues to investigate. Though it remains to be seen whether the body will recommend amending UK law to better regulate political activity on digital platforms. The UK’s Prime Minister waded into the disinformation debate herself last month by publicly accusing the Russian government of seeking to “weaponize information” by planting fake stories and photoshopped images to try to sow discord in the West. And the so-far disclosed extent of Russian divisive content targeting the US electorate — which in October Facebook admitted could have reached as many as 126 million people — should give politicians in any democracy plenty of pause for thought about major tech platforms.  \n",

            "Facebook is trying to close the augmented reality gap with Snapchat with the help of an army of third-party developers. Today, eight months after debuting its Augmented Reality Camera Effects platform and AR Studio tool at F8, Facebook is allowing all developers to start building AR experiences for its Facebook Camera. That includes “World Effects” — Facebook’s copy of Snapchat’s World Lenses — that augment your environment with 3D objects rather than just your selfies. AR Studio becomes available to all developers today, and World Effects will open up there in the next few days for use on Facebook and Messenger. For example, on Messenger you’ll be able to add a 3D heart floating above someone’s head, add an arrow to point to something in a panorama or add a celebrating robot that plays music to jazz up a drab video. Facebook’s new World Effects “We want artists, developers, brands and more creators to be able to build and share amazing AR experiences,” writes Facebook director Ficus Kirkpatrick. “By opening AR Studio to all creators, we’re taking steps towards making AR more a part of everyday life.” Facebook’s opportunity here is to take advantage of Snapchat’s anti-developer attitude. Snapchat has yet to fully embrace third-party AR content beyond some basic image frame submissions and work with a few fine artists like Jeff Koons. Meanwhile, Facebook has been operating a developer platform for more than a decade, and has fostered a huge community of coders looking to get their content in front of Facebook’s massive 2 billion user audience. Since launching the Camera Effects platform, Facebook has worked with more than 2,000 brands, publishers and artists to make AR experiences. This could lay the groundwork for Sponsored World Effects, which might let businesses pay to offer branded AR toys inside of Facebook. Facebook’s AR Studio makes it easy to tie animations and imagery to certain cues like someone raising their eyebrows “We’ve been continuously advancing the capabilities of the platform, with improved face tracking, new graphics capabilities, better scripting, and now world effects. This is only the beginning, and we can’t wait to see how creators bring art to life through AR Studio.” Users can open the Facebook or Messenger Camera, scroll through the World Effects and tap to add one to what they’re seeing. Some other launch experiences include a unicorn you can play with, or the ability to add floating 3D word bubbles like “love,” “bae,” “heart” and “miss you.” Facebook has encountered some stumbling blocks in its quest for AR. Facebook Stories, where Camera Effects content is typically shared, hasn’t taken off the way Instagram Stories has. Now it’s resorted to allowing users to cross-post to Facebook Stories from Instagram or Messenger, but they still don’t get many views. Meanwhile, Apple’s ARKit and Google’s ARCore give developers an alternative way to build AR into their own apps at the operating system level rather than having to piggyback on Facebook. Essentially, Facebook’s best lure to developers is its inherent reach thanks to a massive baked-in audience. But if Facebook Stories aren’t popular to watch, that audience isn’t easily accessible. Its best bet might be opening the Camera Effects platform and World Lenses to Instagram where tons of people watch Stories. The real world is too vast for a single company to spice up with augmented reality. But by crowdsourcing development, Facebook could eventually offer AR experiences connected to any location, real-world object, holiday or activity. That breadth of offering will be key to becoming the default way people explore the AR world. Whichever app offers the most and best experiences will be the one people wave in the air to see what’s hidden out of view.  \n",

            "18 Facebook will no longer always divert international advertising revenue to Ireland\n",
            "Facebook  today said it is shifting to a “local selling structure” in countries outside the U.S., in which its advertising revenue in that country will be recorded by their local company in the country. That means that rather than directly route its revenue to its international headquarters in Dublin, local policymakers and governments will potentially get an opportunity for greater visibility into the company’s revenue related to local advertising sales. The change comes amid a period where there is increasing scrutiny over companies that have held offshore revenue, especially in Ireland, where the European Commission in October slammed Dublin for failing to collect unpaid taxes from Apple. “We believe that moving to a local selling structure will provide more transparency to governments and policy-makers around the world who have called for greater visibility over the revenue associated with locally supported sales in their countries,” Facebook CFO Dave Wehner said in a blog post today. It’s not clear whether this will actually have a significant impact on Facebook’s existing structure. But there has been increased scrutiny on international corporations that generate a lot of revenue outside the U.S., like Apple and Facebook. As Facebook begins to expand even further internationally, it will also have to ensure that it has the right systems in place with local governments so it can operate without a ton of pressure. The vast majority of Facebook’s 2 billion-plus monthly active users are, of course, outside the U.S., though they still generate significantly less revenue on a per-user base than those in North America. The U.S. and Canada still make up the biggest segment of Facebook’s advertising revenue, though it’s clear the company wants to continue to grow those international businesses. But it’s going to have to do so while cooperating with local governments as it continues to expand.  The company said it will implement this plan throughout 2018, with the goal of completing all offices by the first half of 2019.  \n",

            "19 Facebook bats back after a second former exec accuses it of negatively impacting society\n",
            "Yesterday, The Verge published comments made by investor and former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya, quoting his interview last month at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, where he echoed recent comments made by former Facebook  president Sean Parker that the platform is having deleterious effects on society. Said Palihapitiya at Stanford, “The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse. No cooperation. Misinformation. Mistruth.” It appears that Palihapitiya made the comments just a day or two after Parker broadcast his own warnings in an interview with Axios, telling interviewer Mike Allen that the thought process behind building the social media giant was: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” Added Parker at the time: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Either way, the one-two punch was evidently more than Facebook  could stomach, perhaps because Palihapitiya’s comments were so widely circulated yesterday — appearing first in The Verge but subsequently in CNBC, Quartz, Business Insider and Fortune. This morning, Facebook issued a statement in which it referred by first name to Palihapitiya, writing: Chamath has not been at Facebook for over six years. When Chamath was at Facebook we were focused on building new social media experiences and growing Facebook around the world. Facebook was a very different company back then and as we have grown we have realised how our responsibilities have grown too. We take our role very seriously and we are working hard to improve. We’ve done a lot of work and research with outside experts and academics to understand the effects of our service on well-being, and we’re using it to inform our product development. We are also making significant investments more in people, technology and processes, and – as Mark Zuckerberg said on the last earnings call – we are willing to reduce our profitability to make sure the right investments are made. It’s a surprising move for the juggernaut, which would normally leave well enough alone. It’s also hard to know which of Palihapitiya’s comments may have struck a nerve, though he accused early employees of knowing on some level that the platform could prove unhealthy but adding that they barreled forward anyway. “I feel tremendous guilt,” Palihapitiya said in his November sit-down. “In the back, deep, deep recesses of our mind, we kind of knew something bad could happen.” Palihapitiya is renowned for making brash comments about a wide range of things, from the ubiquity of Kind bars to the lack of diversity in the venture industry to his steadfast belief that Amazon is not a monopoly. He has also capitalized on his time at Facebook, where he as once VP of user growth, to cultivate his own investment firm, Social Capital, often promoting the fact that it has its own internal platform team. Some of its members came from the Facebook Growth team, including Ray Ko, who reported to Palihapitiya at Facebook, and Jonathan Hsu, who helped start its data science practice. Today, Social Capital uses their collective expertise to help its portfolio companies figure out their own growth strategies.  \n",

            "20 Facebook is trying to make the Poke happen again\n",
            "Facebook’s  “Poke” feature has never really gone away, but now the social network is giving it a more prominent placement – and is even considering expanding the set of casual greeting options to include others, like a wink, wave, high-five or hug. Though Facebook had never really discontinued the age-old feature, which serves as a quick way to get someone’s attention on its network, it has now given the Poke a highly visible spot. At the top of users’ profiles on mobile, the Poke button sits next to a Message button, and right below your friend’s name and photo.  The Poke is one of Facebook’s oldest features. It existed at a time when the social network was still called Thefacebook, and there wasn’t as much to do on the site as there is today. The meaning of the Poke was never defined, as Facebook decided to leave it up to interpretation. “When we created the poke, we thought it would be cool to have a feature without any specific purpose,” Facebook had explained in the past. “People interpret the poke in many different ways, and we encourage you to come up with your own meanings.” Of course, many people took the Poke to be a form of virtual flirting while others saw it as more of  a joke. Poke wars between friends ensued, as well. Now it looks like Facebook wants to give the Poke another shot. The new Poke button’s placement also makes it easier accidental Pokes to occur, when you were aiming for the Message button instead, or just browsing through a user’s profile. For this reason, not everyone is thrilled with the new button, it seems: The new Facebook app makes it too easy to poke people. That was supposed to be hard to get to so girls knew you were really thinking about them. — Dave M (@dmm117) December 3, 2017  Okay, but Facebook has now made it far too easy to accidentally ‘poke’ someone. It’s right on the top of their profile. I don’t need that stress in my life. — Erinn Victoria (@erinn_victoria) December 2, 2017  Did you know you can still “poke” people on Facebook? I didn’t. Until I ACCIDENTALLY POKED SOMEONE LAST NIGHT and they poked me back. 😑 — Alice Smith Avery (@alicees28) December 8, 2017  Because the feature is from an earlier era of Facebook history, the Poke is actually somewhat mysterious to some users who don’t know what the feature does or why it’s there. Others, who do remember the Poke, assumed it had been removed and has just now returned:   does anyone know what the “poke” button on facebook means? I just found out i had 288 pokes, some were from like 2012 but i poked all them back so whatever. — Hannah Evans (@hannah_cathryn_) December 8, 2017  This seems like a bad time for Facebook to bring back the \"poke\" feature. — Loueyville (@loueyville) December 7, 2017  So Facebook brought back the “poke” button — Marisa Lee Martin (@MarisaLeeMartin) December 7, 2017  I THINK THEY HAVE POKE BACK ON FACEBOOK 🤯 — [ SMIIRK ] (@smiirkmusic) December 7, 2017  Why did Facebook bring back the poke!? 👉 — Stephanie (@peaseymarie) December 7, 2017  But the Poke had never been shut off for good – it was just tucked away in the navigation. Now, it’s sort of impossible to miss. Facebook isn’t done with the Poke yet, either. The company has been testing a new series of greetings including hello, high-fiving, hugging, and winking, in addition to the Poke, The Next Web recently discovered. These also sit at the top of users’ profiles for those who have been added to the test group, and appear as bright, colorful buttons. (It had tested a “hello” button earlier this year, as well.)  Above: a demo of the new Greetings feature on Facebook The idea with Greetings is to offer Facebook users more ways to reach out to friends, beyond posting to their profiles, commenting and direct messaging. With these more lightweight interactions, you can show a friend you’re thinking about them with little effort on your part. But Facebook will need to be careful with the launch of Pokes and Greetings. In the past, some women said the Facebook Poke often felt like a creepy flirting tool, for example. If the new Greetings buttons or the new Poke button are available to anyone on Facebook to access, and not just a user’s friends, they could be abused as a way to pester someone online. Not everyone has the test of the Greetings buttons or the new Poke button, we understand. Facebook would not confirm if or when it would make these features publicly available to all.  \n",

            "21 Time’s up for the Ticker? Facebook appears to axe feed for tracking your friends’ activity\n",
            "As Facebook  continues to tinker with its layout and services to spur more interactions and engagement, it seems that not even the most well-known or oldest features are spared. In the most recent development, it looks like Facebook has quietly removed the Ticker, the box that used to appear to the right of your News Feed to summarize what all your friends have been liking, commenting on, and generally doing on the social network. The removal has come after several weeks of people reporting the feature suddenly disappearing for them. Sometime in the last week, on a thread in Facebook’s Help Community started by one of those users, a verified member of the Facebook help team simply announced that “This feature is no longer available.” The question has also now been closed to further comments. It’s not clear why Facebook decided to axe the Ticker. We have contacted the company to see if it can explain more. Generally, Facebook is no stranger to killing off features that are either not being used, or are not progressing in the way it had anticipated, or to bring more focus on other features. I’m guessing that the removal might be down to a combination of all three of those: little in the way of click-throughs to posts from the Ticker (did you notice it missing?); some general unease over the voyeuristic aspect of quietly watching what others are doing on the site; and on top of that, a push from Facebook to throw a little more promotional power to other engagement efforts. Currently, my right column features a carousel of friends who are posting Stories (Facebook’s newish Snapchat-esque ephemeral photo and video montages). Under that are some prompts to update Pages that I am involved with; upcoming events; trending topics; and ads. If it’s gone for good, the Ticker is one of the more legacy features to get the chop at Facebook. The Ticker was first launched in 2011, to coincide with Facebook introducing an algorithmic News Feed. Instead of showing you your friends’ most recent posts and interactions in the News Feed, Facebook surfaced posts that it deemed more relevant or interesting to you, as well as posts that were already getting a lot of traction. So the aim of the Ticker was to complement this by giving you a time-based summary of all activity to help you keep tabs on everything if you wanted to anyway, and use those alerts as jumping-in points to start interacting yourself. The Ticker, however, was not without controversy — some had dubbed it the “creeper feed” when it first launched because of how it let you quietly keep tabs on what people in your network were doing on the site. Facebook itself seems to have considered removing it before, but it never actually did. (Facebook instead created an option to mute it, or turn it on; that option is now also gone.) Facebook more recently has been attempting a fairly fundamental shift, moving from its original core premise of connecting friends, to now positioning itself as a place for information about more than just your friends. (It even changed its mission statement, from “making the world more open and connected,” to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”) Facebook has long been chipping away at Google’s and primary media outlets’ position as a purveyor of information, turning into the world’s biggest platform for aggregating and distributing news. But with a lot of controversy over how much fake news is shared on the site, and how that could have influenced major political events like the EU referendum in the UK and the last US general election, Facebook is using its new mission statement to spearhead a more proactive stance about how and what news and other information gets shared on its platform. And that, at last, may be the other reason why the Ticker is no more: it was, in a way, a throwback to Old Facebook. But it’s not just about Facebook’s new positioning; offering a way to keep tabs on your friends may not really be how people use or view Facebook’s role today.  \n",

            "22 These are Facebook’s internal policies on harassment and bullying\n",
            "Facebook,  in a similar manner to what it did with its internal policies around Managing Bias, is making publicly available its policies on harassment and bullying. Facebook also has outlined its investigation process as a result of harassment or bullying allegations. Facebook says it is doing this now because “lots of really brave women have raised their hands recently to take a stand to begin the process of changing culture and raising awareness,” Facebook VP of People Lori Goler told me over the phone.”I think this a moment where, together, companies can create lasting change. It seems like a good time to foster the conversation to be sure we don’t have many, many, many more years of women who have to raise their hands.” At a high level, Facebook’s policies prohibit intimidating, offensive and sexual conduct “even when that conduct might not meet the legal standard of harassment,” Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Goler wrote on Facebook’s blog. Examples of harassment, as outlined in Facebook’s policy, include derogatory or insensitive jokes, pranks or comments, slurs or epithets, unwelcome sexual advances or invitations and sharing offensive images that are derogatory or sexual. Facebook’s policy outlines additional examples here. The company’s policy also makes clear that excuses like, “I was joking” or “I didn’t mean it that way” are not legitimate defenses to allegations. Nor are excuses of being under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol legitimate defenses. Facebook maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward harassment, which means “that when we are able to determine that harassment has occurred, those responsible are fired,” they wrote. Facebook has, in fact, had to fire people as a result of sexual harassment, Goler confirmed to me over the phone. There are, of course, other things that can happen. “In some cases investigations are unfortunately inconclusive and come down to one person’s word against another,” they wrote on the blog. In the event Facebook can’t terminate someone, they may change someone’s role and who they report to. Other policies, which center around six principles, entail developing standards for respectful behavior at work, mandatory harassment training for managers and interns, treating all claims with urgency and respect, having an investigation process that “protects employees from stigma or retaliation,” maintaining a process that is “consistently applied in every case” and making it clear that “anyone who is silent or looks the other way is complicit.” Although no major harassment allegations have come out of Facebook, the company is not perfect. In May, a WSJ report claimed Facebook had gender bias in its engineering department. Facebook, however, rejected those claims. And last February, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had to ask employees to stop crossing out “Black Lives Matter” on the walls at one of Facebook’s Menlo Park buildings. In light of the more recent incidents of sexual harassment in the tech industry, Goler says Facebook has not made any changes to its policies because the company has found its policies work pretty well. She added that Facebook is not claiming to have all the answers, but wanted to share with the tech community at large the policies its company has in place. It’s also something smaller companies have asked for from Facebook, she said. While companies compete in a lot of areas, this doesn’t need to be one of them, Goler said. She said she envisions other companies sharing their policies so that tech companies can work together to make corporate culture better for everyone.  \n",

            "23 Facebook Sound Collection lets you add no-name music to videos\n",
            "The right soundtrack can make a boring video interesting. So after years of reported discussions with the record labels, Facebook  is launching video editing tool Sound Collection for inserting into Facebook and Instagram clips “songs, vocals, noises, and instrumental tracks spanning genres like hip hop, pop, jazz, country, and more.” What you can’t add is any music you’ve heard before. Sound Collection has huge potential, but lackluster execution, and probably won’t deter users from illegally adding popular music to their videos. Sound Collection comes alongside a slew of other new resources for video makers following the launch of Facebook’s “Creator” app last month that caters to web influencers. They include a new hub with educational materials related to 360 media production, a 360 camera loaner program and a page featuring tools for 360 video editing. The goal with the launches is to help video creators build and grow on Facebook, the company says. With the Facebook Sound Collection (rolling out to everyone here over the next few days), creators can access a free set of high-quality audio tracks and sound effects they can use in their videos on Facebook and Instagram, without having to worry with copyright or payment. That’s because Facebook has bought the rights from composers and songwriters. Facebook says more tracks and effects will be added in the future as the collection grows. It seems a bit like the Vine Soundboard feature the now-defunct video app offered for pasting in sound effects. Video creators using the service also can take advantage of new discovery tools that allow them to learn about the different artists, follow those they like and browse the sounds by genre, mood, length and vocals. Some of the debut tracks include those from artists like singer-songwriter Kiri Tse, Indian percussionist Jim Santi Owen and guitarist and film composer Lyle Workman.  Those are far from Top 40 artists. The New York Times reported earlier this year that Facebook has been in talks with the major record labels since at least 2015. Right now, it’s forced to block or take down videos that it detects using popular copyrighted music. So if you slapped Dad’s favorite Bob Dylan song on that 60th birthday vacation montage you made in iMovie, it could get removed from Facebook. The social network has been hoping for a better solution. Apparently it hasn’t reached such an agreement yet, as the current crop of artists aren’t well-known. Lyle Workman did an acoustic cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Fortunate Son” that he recorded for TV show Sons of Anarchy. That’s about as close to popular as Sound Collection’s artists gets right now. But if Facebook pays up for some big-name music as soundtrack options, it could see more viewership for the videos it already uploads and entice creation of more. TechCrunch has been griping about Facebook’s bare-bones video editor since 2013, and 18 months ago begged for improvements to the embarrassingly outdated feature, including a soundtracking option. “This update begins to solve a problem I’ve heard from creators — they love making and sharing videos on Facebook and Instagram, but it can often be difficult to find audio or sounds to include,” writes Facebook’s head of video Fidji Simo. Hopefully Facebook is serious about investing in Sound Collection so you don’t have to turn to third-party editing apps or get slapped for copyright infringement. Meanwhile, the new 360 Community page launching today is offering a suite of tools for those creating 360 degree videos for Facebook. Since launching back in 2015, Facebook says more than a million 360 videos have been shared on its platform. But creating these videos has not been easy, because it requires special equipment, and a host of other challenges.  The page includes a variety of resources, like tutorials on topics like getting started with 360 cameras, 360 video editing workflows and an introduction to spatial audio. Facebook also plans to hold 360 community meetups so creators can collaborate. Facebook is launching 360 Director for Pages and profiles so they can add text and graphic annotations to videos, and guide where people should look with a default view that can move around as people watch if they don’t scroll themselves. It’s expanding Player Controls for choosing the zoom, direction and preview thumbnail so user profiles can make these adjustments, not just Pages. And you can save drafts for later if you make changes before you upload.  Creators can borrow a ZCam S1 for free The new Community page also aims to address problems by giving creators the ability to borrow from Blend Media 360 cameras for their upcoming projects and experiments. Initially, loaners include the GoPro Fusion and ZCam S1, and other cameras will be added in the coming months. It’s free for creators to borrow a camera, Facebook tells us, but the kicker is that it asks that some of the content created with the loaner gear gets shared to Facebook. Since 2012, YouTube has offered “YouTube Spaces,” where creators can come use high-quality equipment to shoot video for the platform. Facebook now lending out its own hardware is another sign that it truly does want to challenge YouTube, not just with random clips you stumble across in News Feed, but with premium content like its new Watch tab of original programming. But to attract the best creators, Facebook needs to prove it can pay out enough to earn their time. That’s still a work in progress.  \n",

            "Last November, Facebook  launched Instant Games, a new platform for gaming with friends inside the Messenger chat app. Today, the company is announcing a couple of notable new features for this gaming platform, including support for live streaming via Facebook Live and video chatting with fellow gamers. The idea with Instant Games is to boost people’s time spent in Messenger by giving them something else to do besides just chat. It also serves as Facebook’s newest attempt to return to dominance in social gaming. The company’s gaming platform years ago had earned a peak of a quarter-billion dollars per quarter on its 30 percent tax on in-game purchases, and it leveraged Facebook’s network effects to help games go viral. But with the shift to mobile, Facebook’s position in gaming declined. These days, people spend more time gaming in native mobile apps built for iOS and Android devices. When Instant Games first launched it offered 20 games across 30 markets, including titles like Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Words With Friends Frenzy. Now that number has grown to over 70 games from more than 100 developers worldwide, the company says, including recently launched Tetris. It will soon add other big names, like Angry Birds (built by CoolGames, who also built Tetris); Sonic Jump from SEGA; Disney Tsum Tsum, published by LINE; and a new game from Puzzle & Dragons maker, GungHo Online Entertainment, Inc.  Angry Birds Teaser Posted by Messenger on Wednesday, December 6, 2017 To mark its one-year anniversary, Facebook is also debuting a couple of new features for its Instant Games: live streaming and video chat. Live streaming begins rolling out today. The feature, powered by Facebook Live, lets Messenger users broadcast their gameplay to their Facebook Page or profile. To use live streaming, you just tap on the new camera icon at the top right of the screen while gaming, then add a short description to be shared alongside your post. To start recording, you press the “Start Live Video” button.  The live broadcast is then shared to your Page or profile. When it ends, friends and fans can watch the saved recording. With the live streaming feature, Facebook is playing catch up rivals like Twitch, YouTube and Microsoft, all of which today offer their own tools and services for live streaming games. However, in Facebook’s case, the addition is more casual – it’s more about sharing with friends, not monetizing a community through subscriptions, game sales, or custom chat icons, as you’d find on Twitch or YouTube, for example. (At least, not yet).  Facebook says it will soon start testing a feature that lets users video chat while gaming, as well. The feature will initially debut next year in Zynga’s Words with Friends, before expanding to other titles. According to the company, over 245 million people video chat every month on Messenger. That makes for a large potential audience for a video chatting feature, which adds interactive element to the gaming experience. The feature will also challenge other popular video chatting and hangout apps popular with teens and young adults, like Fam, the app for group video chat via iMessage, for example, or Microsoft’s Skype, among others. As part of today’s news, Facebook shared a few stats from its gaming partners. You can see these below:  Games on Messenger Posted by Messenger on Wednesday, December 6, 2017  \n",

            "Today, Sundance Film Festival announced its lineup for next month. Included yet again were the entrants for the festival’s New Frontiers program, which hosts VR content, and an unlikely film title made the list this year, Wolves in the Walls. Virtual reality may not be the technology du jour in Silicon Valley as much as it was the past couple of years, but there are still plenty of milestones being traversed in the cinematic VR community, which continues to believe that VR’s dominance in future entertainment is a question of when not if. Earlier this year, it was announced that Facebook’s Oculus Story Studio would be abruptly shutting down, the 50 employees on its staff would be let go and their main project, Wolves in the Walls, would be shuttered. This was a major blow to many in the VR community who admired much of the pioneering work that the Emmy-award winning studio had built. The studio’s latest project, Dear Angelica, had been one of the most moving films in the medium that I’d seen, the product of a moving narrative and an artistic style that was only possible in VR. All of this didn’t stop a core team of employees from Oculus Story Studio from continuing to pursue hopes that the project they’d put so much work into would eventually see the light of day. With support from Oculus, the team has spent the past several months holed up in a studio in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood getting Wolves in the Walls ready for Sundance. The film, directed by Pete Billington, is based on a Neil Gaiman story and follows a little girl discovering what’s hiding inside the walls of her room. You can check out a peek of the film’s design here.  Oculus Story Studio has always looked to do more than create beautiful stuff, the work they have done in VR has always seemed to be ahead of the curve and particularly apt at predicting trends that would disperse across VR creation. With Dear Angelica, the team built a pipeline that allowed visuals to be designed entirely inside VR; with Wolves in the Walls, the studio is taking a closer look at how VR film-making can interact with AI tech to bring characters and viewers into more close-knit relationships. They’re working with an immersive theater company to choreograph how they interact with the space, as well. For​ ​the​ ​first​ ​time​ ​in​ ​a​ ​movie,​ ​the​ ​audience​ ​is​ ​cast​ ​as​ ​a​ ​character,​ ​and​ ​will​ ​be​ ​there​ ​to​ ​help​ ​Lucy​ ​overcome​ ​the obstacles​ ​in​ ​front​ ​of​ ​her. ​This​ ​is​ ​a​ ​VR​ ​fable​ ​about​ ​the​ ​nature​ ​of​ ​fear.​ ​It​ ​is​ ​also​ ​a​ ​story​ ​about​ ​family.​ ​The​ ​youngest members​ ​of​ ​our​ ​pack​ ​often​ ​see​ ​things​ ​the​ ​most​ ​clearly,​ ​but​ ​they​ ​are​  also​ ​the​ ​easiest​ ​to​ ​ignore.​ ​Lucy​ ​needs​ ​our​ ​help​ ​to convince​ ​her​ ​family​ ​that​ ​something​ ​is​ ​very​ ​wrong​ ​inside​ ​the​ ​house. It’s still unclear what the future looks like for the ragtag group of incredibly talented creators at Oculus Story Studio without Oculus, but the group detailed that they’ll be sharing more soon. Wolves in the Walls premieres at Sundance later next month.  \n",

            "26 As tbh popularity wanes, Facebook launches ‘Did You Know’ social questionnaire\n",
            "Facebook  wants you to share a bit more about yourself on your profile, so today it’s launching a new feature to web and mobile users called “Did You Know,” where you can answer questions about yourself to clue friends into your secrets, dreams, goals and feelings.  As people back away from statuses and focus more on sharing articles, videos and photos, this feature offers an opportunity for users to answer questions about themselves more directly. So many of Facebook’s recent efforts to change how people customize their profiles have seemed to get buried in the clutter. The inherent share-ability of this might play a bit nicer given its visibility; you can share with the customized colorful backgrounds that FB has pushed on its statuses already. This feature also really seems like the early stages of something that could lead to more sophisticated advertiser profiles, but at the moment the questions are honestly pretty hokey. Here’s a smattering of the questions Facebook said could pop up in the “did you know?” section: The feature is all a tad reminiscent of what tbh was doing to integrate asking users light and friendly questions about their friends. This is the other side of the coin, asking users to talk more about themselves. Tbh, which Facebook acquired in October, has tanked in the App Store ratings, dropping from being the No. 1 downloaded app around when it was purchased to being the 771st most-downloaded app in the U.S. currently, according to App Annie data. The startup said it had 2.5 million daily active users when Facebook acquired it. tbh App Annie rankings A healthy amount of these features eventually seem to find themselves as dead-ends, but Facebook is obviously looking to explore how it can goad users to get more comfortable answering questions about themselves and their friends. It’s obvious why they would want to build this type of relationship, but whether they’ll find success with apps like tbh and this new profile feature remains a bit unclear.  \n",

            "27 Africa Roundup: ToLet Acquires JumiaHouse NG, Facebook announces NG_Hub, Interswitch IPO Update\n",
            "Lagos based online real estate startup ToLet.com.ng acquired Jumia House Nigeria for an undisclosed amount. Jumia House is a subsidiary of the continent’s lone tech unicorn — Pan-African e-commerce giant Jumia.com. ToLet and Jumia House Nigeria will merge platforms under the new name PropertyPro.ng. The $1.2 million Series A startup was able to buy part of a $1 billion company with the help of its lead investor, Frontier Digital Ventures (FDV). While ToLet originally reported to TechCrunch that FDV served primarily as a facilitator of the deal, both now confirm FDV helped finance the deal. FDV went a little further, and acquired 100 percent interests in Jumia House Ghana, and Jumia House Angola, according to a company spokesperson. The new PropertyPro entity will combine ToLet’s and Jumia House NG’s listings to create the largest online real estate listings platform in Nigeria with 65 percent of the market, according to ToLet Co-Founder Sulaiman Balogun. The platform will generate revenues primarily from agent subscription fees. PropertyPro will also expand agents and listings across Nigeria and be available on an Android app.   Facebook’s New Nigeria Hub Facebook announced the 2018 opening of NG_Hub, a Lagos based tech space managed in partnership with CcHub Nigeria. TechCrunch checked in with CcHub CEO Bosun Tijani on the hub’s core details. “I think the core of it is for Facebook to place a bet on high tech startups…that may not get a chance in Africa―augmented reality, artificial intelligence…data driven ventures―and build a space that can support startups at that level,” he said. The actual space will be based Yaba, Tijani told TechCrunch, referring to Lagos’s unofficial IT district. “There will be a virtual reality lab, a creator lab, and a co-working space within it,” he said. “The program will not be limited to the space itself,” according to Tijani, who said NG_Hub will “run an acceleration program…so other technology hubs from across Nigeria can also support startups through the program.” An official opening will likely be sometime in Q1 of 2018.  Update on Africa’s IPO Landscape Nigerian fintech firm Interswitch—which provides much of Nigeria’s digital banking and payments infrastructure—will likely go public on the LSE in 2019, according to company statements and sources. As reported in TechCrunch in 2016, the Helios Investment Partners backed company (now beyond startup phase) was poised for a listing on the London stock exchanges at a $1 billion valuation. Nearly two years on it hasn’t happened, delaying what would have been Africa’s first big listing on a foreign exchange by a VC backed tech company. In a September 2017 interview, Interswitch Divisional Chief Executive Officer Akeem Lawal named “unfavorable equity markets” and reaffirmed an IPO, saying “It will happen before the end of 2019.” TechCrunch checked in with a couple of Nigerian tech insiders on Interswitch’s prospects to become Africa’s first big IPO — and the possibility another venture could beat them to it. Paga CEO Tayo Oviosu named Nigeria’s “macroeconomic situation” and “ volatility of the Naira” as culprits for the delay—noting the Nigerian economy and Naira improved in 2017. On timing for an Interswitch public listing, “They’re gearing themselves up to go back and do an IPO…probably not next year, more likely the year after,” Oviosu told TechCrunch. Omobola Johnson — Nigeria’s former Minister of Communication Technology and Senior Partner at TLCom Capital — thinks Interswitch is still ripe to go public. “Interswitch as a company…still continues to do well…Interswitch is still growing, it’s still profitable, and it still has significant market share in Nigeria and other African markets…They are still very strong to be the [continent’s] first significant tech IPO,” Johnson said. She named Andela, Twiga Foods, and Flutterwave as other future Africa IPO contenders, for a 3-5 year window.                      More Africa Related Stories @TechCrunch ·         This Tech Startup Is Trying To Tackle Waste in Africa ·         Shujaa Delivery Aims to Complete With Aramax, DHL, and Others African Tech Around The Net     ·         MEST Launches Incubator Spaces in Lagos, Cape Town―@VentureBurn ·         African Fintech Company JUMO Raises US$24M for Expansion―@ITWebAfrica ·         Female-Focused Angel Investment Fund Launched in Africa―@DisruptAfrica ·         AFF Disrupt To Herald Nigeria’s First Fintech Accelerator―@TechCabal ·         China’s Transsion Dominates Africa Mobile Phone Market―@FT ·         Hiring Firm Shortlist Acquires East Africa’s Spire Education―@TechWeez ·         Africa Set to Top 1 Billion Mobile Internet Connections In Five Years―@Reuters ·         Technology May Help Compensate for Africa’s Lack of Manufacturing―@TheEconomist  \n",

            "As Pinterest  looks to further expand beyond just the audience you’d expect to use it, it’s going to have to start chasing down users and meet them on different territories — and that includes messaging apps. So today Pinterest is launching a pair of updates that is going to help it tap into that audience of people that are sharing content on Facebook Messenger. People might already be copying links to Pinterest and pasting them in Messenger, but the company is looking to make that a little more seamless to get to the point where you can go into Messenger and be able to regularly interact with Pinterest. The bot works as you’d expect — you open up a chat with the Pinterest bot and type in an idea you’re interested in, like food or clothing. The bot will then start recommending ideas from Pinterest, for which you can take a deeper dive in at any point if you’re interested in them. Pinterest is the latest in a wave of companies to see some kind of opportunity in a platform like Messenger, though it still seems the full story on that has yet to play out. The chat extension brings Pinterest’s experience closer to the Messenger experience, allowing users to both link out pins in a Facebook message and dive deeper into that content within the messenger. So when you go into a pin on Messenger, you’ll start to see and feel something that is a little bit like the core Pinterest experience without actually leaving Messenger. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen Pinterest start to look beyond just its home platform in order to get people closer and closer to executing on an idea. Pinterest earlier this year rolled out QR codes that will show up in stores, another move that’s trying to collapse the distance between a user’s everyday behavior and getting them to actually get on Pinterest and start saving content. With more than 200 million monthly active users, Pinterest is still a bit of a blip compared to Facebook — though, the audience behavior is certainly different in a lot of ways. But as Pinterest looks to continue to grow, it has to start looking in places that it might not normally look in order to get people interested in the service. Getting tied more closely with Facebook Messenger, a service with more than 1 billion users, seems like a pretty natural place to start.  \n",

            "29 Facebook ‘Messenger Kids’ lets under-13s chat with whom parents approve\n",
            "For the first time, Facebook  is opening up to children under age 13 with a privacy-focused app designed to neutralize child predator threats that plague youth-focused competitors like Snapchat. Rolling out today on iOS in the U.S., “Messenger Kids” lets parents download the app on their child’s phone or tablet, create a profile for them and approve friends and family with whom they can text and video chat from the main Messenger app. Tweens don’t sign up for a Facebook account and don’t need a phone number, but can communicate with other Messenger and Messenger Kids users parents sign-off on, so younger siblings don’t get left out of the family group chat. “We’ve been working closely with the FTC so we’re lockstep with them. ‘This works’, they said,” Facebook product management director Loren Cheng tells me. “In other apps, they can contact anyone they want or be contacted by anyone,” Facebook’s head of Messenger David Marcus notes. Special proactive detection safety filters prevent children from sharing nudity, sexual content or violence, while a dedicated support team will respond quickly to reported or flagged content. Facebook even manually sifted Giphy to build a kid-friendly version of the GIF-sharing engine. And with childish augmented reality masks and stickers, video calls with grandma could be a lot more fun and a lot less silent or awkward.  Facebook won’t be directly monetizing Messenger Kids, automatically migrating kids to real accounts when they turn 13 or collecting data so that it complies with Children’s Online Privacy Protections Act (COPPA) law. But the app could prime kids to become lifelong Facebook users, and lock their families deeply into the platform where they’ll see ads. “When you think about things at scale that we do to get people to care more about Messenger, this is one that addresses a real need for parents,” say Facebook’s head of Messenger David Marcus. “But the side effect will be that they use Messenger more and create family groups.” Marcus tells me he’s excited about getting his 8-year-old into the family chat alongside his 14- and 17-year-old children. It’s important to understand that kids under 13 still can’t sign up for a Facebook account. Instead, parents download the Messenger Kids app to a child’s iPhone or iPad (Android coming soon). Once the parent has authenticated it with their own account, they set up a mini-profile with their kid’s name and photo. Then, using the Messenger Kids bookmark in the main Facebook app, parents can approve anyone who is friends with them as a contact for their kid, like aunts and uncles or godparents. Messenger Kids is interoperable with the main Messenger app, so adults don’t actually have to download the Kids app.  Kids still can’t be found through Facebook search, which protects their privacy. So if a child wants to be able to chat with one of their classmates, their parent must first friend that kid’s parent, and then will see the option to approve that adult’s child as a contact for their own kid. This is by far the most clumsy part of Messenger Kids, and something Facebook might be able to improve with a way for Messenger Kids to let children perhaps photograph a QR code on their playmate’s app to request that their parents connect. When children open the Messenger Kids app, they’ll see a color-customizable home screen with big tiles representing their existing chat threads and approved contacts, with their last message and the last time they were online. From there, kids can dive instantly into a video chat or text thread with their contacts. No message content is collected for ad targeting (same as Messenger), and there’s no in-app purchases to worry about. Kids can block and unblock their parent-approved contacts.  Facebook hired a special team to develop kid-friendly creative tools, from fidget spinner and dinosaur AR masks to crayon-style stickers. “Video calls become so much more playful with AR,” says Marcus. Sometimes after 5 or 10 minutes it’s really hard to have a sustained conversation with a 7-year-old,” but kids can joke around with Grampa using the selfie filters when they run out of run-on stories to tell them. Messenger features like location sharing and payments have been stripped out, while the Kids version of Giphy won’t let you search for things like “sex.” Facebook actually manually selected a set of GIFs that kids can use rather than relying on a third-party startup to tag things well enough. Still, a reporting interface written specifically for kids lets them flag anything sketchy to a dedicated support team working 24/7. One thing that might surprise some people is that there’s no way for parents to secretly spy on what their kids are saying in their chats. Instead, parents have to ask to look at their kids’ screen, which Chung says is a more common behavior pattern. The exception is that if kids report a piece of objectionable content, their parents will be notified but still not shown the content in their own app.  In June, The Information reported Facebook was working on an app for teens called Talk, though that’s a bit different than this pre-teen Messenger Kids app. While Facebook said in the briefing that the app was designed for kids age 6 to 12, younger kids are allowed on, too. When children turn 13, they won’t instantly have their Messenger Kids profiles turned into real Facebook profiles, nor will they get kicked off Messenger Kids. They’ll still have to build a traditional Facebook account from scratch when they’re ready. Before Facebook wrote any code or drew any designs for the app, it says it started research 18 months ago to find out what kids and parents wanted out of a potential product. It also worked with the National Parent Teacher Association for safety insights and Blue Star Families from the military who have to stay in touch during long deployments. It found that kids had the right hardware but the wrong software; 93 percent of 6-12-year-olds in the U.S. have access to tablets or smartphones, while 66 percent have their own device, and three out of every five parents surveyed said their kids under 13 use messaging apps, social media or both. But these apps weren’t built for children’s privacy, and instead allow adult strangers to contact or follow kids. Youth favorite Snapchat has reportedly been used by predators to groom kids for sexual exploitation, with authorities saying it’s tough to track perverts because messages disappear. Most apps say that kids have to be at least 13, but there’s nothing to stop younger children from signing up. That’s true on Facebook too, and it could do more to prevent tweens from signing up. But at least parents have grown to understand Facebook. On Snapchat, where ephemerality can cover evidence of inappropriate contact, or Musical.ly, where kids dance provocatively in front of huge audiences, dangers mount and parents are often clueless. That’s why it was smart that Facebook tasked Cheng with leading the project. He’d spent the past few years on the “tough experiences” team that handles fake accounts, violent content, sexual exploitation, self-harm and counter-terrorism. He’s used to thinking about worst-case scenarios. Facebook built a whole portal at MessengerKids.com with more information for parents. Facebook is trying to cross every T and dot every I when it comes to safety with this new product. It would be reckless to invite kids onto a chat app otherwise. Still, it doesn’t have the best track record on unintended consequences, and if it screws this up, the damage and backlash will be massive.  The launch could be a sign that Facebook is growing up. With Facebook almost 14 years old itself, children not yet born when it launched are now allowed on its main app. CEO Mark Zuckerberg just had two kids. So did his lieutenants Chris Cox, CPO, and Andrew Bosworth, head of hardware. It’s hard to think about connecting the world if your products can’t connect your own family. “When I was in my mid-twenties, you never think you’re going to be gone, ever,” Marcus admits. Now 33, “[Zuckerberg] has been thinking a lot about the future he wants to leave behind for his kids.” Today his company is laying the foundation for an ageless social network.  \n",

            "30 Facebook will temporarily disable a tool that lets advertisers exclude people of color\n",
            "Facebook  has been under fire for its practices and policies that enable advertisers to exclude “multicultural affinity” groups from the audiences they reach via the social network. Now, in light of a ProPublica investigation and pressure from the Congressional Black Caucus, Facebook says it’s committed to taking a closer look at its advertising policies, its COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a letter to CBC Chairperson Cedric Richmond. Until Facebook figures out how to ensure advertisers don’t use its tools in a discriminatory way, Facebook will temporarily disable the option that lets advertisers exclude multicultural affinity groups from their audience. As Sandberg wrote in her letter to the CBC, multicultural affinity groups “are made up of people whose activities on Facebook suggest they may be interested in ads related to the African American, Hispanic American, or Asian American communities.” Multicultural marketing, Sandberg said in her letter, is common in the ad industry. There are “many legitimate uses for this kind of marketing,” she said, but there are also concerns that advertisers use Facebook to discriminate against people in the areas of housing, employment and credit loans. “By allowing online advertisers to promote or market a community or home for the purpose of sale to select an ‘ethnic affinity’ as part of their advertising campaign, Facebook is complicit in promoting restrictive housing practices,” members of the CBC said last year. Facebook said it also will take a look at how advertisers are using exclusion targeting across other “sensitive segments,” like ones that relate to members of the LGBTQ community and people with disabilities.  \n",

            "31 Facebook drops fee on donations, will match $50M/year, adds Mentor feature\n",
            "Facebook  has always been about friends, but now it’s seeking a broader purpose. So today, Facebook is lending a hand with what it does best: social connections, APIs, and money. At its second Facebook Social Good Forum conference in New York City, the social network just unveiled a slew of new philanthropy-minded features and initiatives. “For all the things that might try to pull people apart, if we can focus more on what brings our communities together, we can build common ground”, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said to kick off the event. “We don’t all agree on everything. One thing I’ve found that people do agree on is the thing that what matters most to us in our lives is family and friends and our communities.”   Facebook is eliminating its 5% fee on donations so 100% of money sent through its Donate buttons go to the desired non-profit. Previously it took 5% to pay for credit card processing and verifying the 750,000 charities on its platform, but will now nobly eat that cost. However, personal fundraisers can still incur fees from 6.9% to 8.8%. It’s setting up a $50 million per year Facebook Donations Fund to match giving on its app to causes like natural disaster relief. Facebook is expanding charitable giving tools to 13 countries in Europe plus Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. It’s launching a Fundraiser API to sync Facebook fundraisers to offsite campaigns, starting with Susan G. Komen, JDRF, National Multiple Sclerosis Society and Movember, with plans to connect to 500 non-profits by end of Spring 2018. Its new Community Help API delivers data from Facebook’s crisis volunteering feature to disaster response organizations to assist them with routing resources. After signing up 4 million blood donors in India, Facebook will expand the program to Bangladesh in 2018.  Finally, it’s launching a new Mentorship feature through partnered non-profits starting with iMentor for education and The International Rescue Committee for crisis recovery. People over 18 in need of addiction recovery, career advancement or other personal help will be matched with vetted mentors who will guide them through an on-Facebook curriculum of education materials. Together, the features could make Facebook a more popular way to donate money, and facilitate delivering support to everyone from disaster victims to at-risk youth.  “Relationships are so important and on average an American has 3 or less people they can really depend on” says Naomi Gleit, Facebook’s VP of social good and longest standing employee other than Mark Zuckerberg. She says that previously, she had to lobby Facebook for one-off funds whenever she though it should match donations around big crises. “Now I have a more sustainable line item in the budget”. Facebook isn’t quite clear how it’s going to run some of these programs, but is committed to learning. Facebook will rely on the success metrics of its Mentorship feature partners to quantify its progress, for example. And Gleit didn’t have answers to how Facebook would avoid bias in choosing which donations its new fund will match. “We don’t have the answers yet. it’s still too early. We need to figure out the specifics over time” Gleit says, but for now Facebook’s Donations Fund will match when the social network solicits donations on its crisis alert pages.  “One of the things that strikes me so much is the deep sense of optimism that you all have” Zuckerberg said as his talked wound down. He explained how pessimism is self-fulfilling, while optimism leads people to try until they succeed. Zuckerberg discussed how from his year of travel around the U.S to “get out of my bubble”, he learned that “our relationships really shape our lives a lot more than I think we realize. If our relationships can help us set our sights just a little higher, we’ll all be better for it.” That’s why he asked his team what it could do, and they came up with this new mentorship feature. “Facebook has mostly focused on connecting us to people we already know” Zuckerberg explained. “But I think it might be just as important to connect people to those outside of their network.” That’s a major shift for Facebook. But also one that could open it to solving new problems and exploring new business opportunities.  People in need are often surrounded by social graphs of others in need, so friends alone can’t always help. But looking beyond, there could be plenty of people willing to serve as role models or who can teach mentees how they pulled themselves out of despair. Some of these mentors might not know their true worth until they see how good it feels to give. Facebook has spent the year embroiled in scandals around fake news, Russian election interference, and violence on Facebook Live. And increasingly, Facebook is being derided for addicting people to mindless feed scrolling. But it’s clear that the company leadership wants Facebook’s legacy to be more positive, and is willing to put its product teams, engineering prowess, and stunning profits to work in service of its mission.

            "A UK parliamentary committee that’s investigating fake news has been told by Facebook and Twitter  they will provide information relating to Russian interference during the UK’s 2016 Brexit referendum vote in the coming weeks. With election disinformation being publicly interrogated in the US, questions have increasingly been asked in the UK about whether foreign government agents also sought to use social channels to drive Brexit propaganda and sway voters. Last month Damian Collins, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, wrote to Facebook and Twitter asking them to look into whether Russian-backed accounts had been used to try to influence voters in the June 2016 in/out EU referendum. The Guardian reports that Collins has also asked senior representatives from the two companies to give evidence on the reach of fake news at the British embassy in Washington in February. Earlier this month, the UK prime minister cranked up the political pressure by publicly accused the Russian government of seeking to “weaponize information” by planting fake stories and photoshopped images to try to meddle in elections and sow discord in the West. In a letter sent to Collins on Friday, Twitter confirmed it would be divulging its own findings soon, writing: “We are currently undertaking investigations into these questions and intend to share our findings in the coming weeks.” Also responding to the committee last week, Facebook noted it had been contacted by the UK’s Electoral Commission about the issue of possible Russian interference in the referendum, as part of enquiries it’s making into whether the use of digital ads and bots on social media broke existing political campaigning rules. “We are now considering how we can best respond to the Electoral Commission’s request for information and expect to respond to them by the second week of December. Given that your letter is about the same issue, we will share our response to the Electoral Commission with you,” Facebook writes. We understand that Google has also been asked by the Electoral Commission to provide it with information pertaining to this probe. Meanwhile, the UK’s data protection watchdog is conducting a parallel investigation into what it describes as “the data-protection risks arising from the use of data analytics, including for political purposes”. Where Brexit is concerned, it’s not yet clear how significant the impact of political disinformation amplified via social media was to the outcome of the vote. But there clearly was a disinformation campaign of sorts. And one that prefigured what appears to have been an even more major effort by Kremlin agents to deflect voters in the US presidential election, just a few months later. After downplaying the impact of ‘fake news’ on the election for months, Facebook recently admitted that Russian-backed content could have reached as many as 126 million US users over the key political period. Earlier this month it also finally admitted to finding some evidence of Brexit disinformation being spread via its platform. Though it claimed it had not found what it dubbed “significant coordination of ad buys or political misinformation targeting the Brexit vote”. Meanwhile, research conducted by a group of academics using Twitter’s API to look at how political information diffused on the platform around the Brexit vote — including looking at how bots and human users interacted — has suggested that more than 156,000 Russian accounts mentioned #Brexit. The researchers also found that Russian accounts posted almost 45,000 messages related to the EU referendum in the 48 hours around the vote (i.e. just before and just after). While another academic study reckoned to have identified 400 fake Twitter accounts being run by Kremlin trolls. Twitter has claimed that external studies based on tweet data pulled via its API cannot represent the full picture of how information is diffused on its platform because the data stream does not take account of any quality filters it might also be applying, nor any controls individual users can use to shape the tweets they see. It reiterates this point in its letter to Collins, writing: … we have found studies of the impact of bots and automation on Twitter necessarily and systematically underrepresent our enforcement actions because these defensive actions are not visible via our APIs, and because they take place shortly after content is created and delivered via our streaming API. Furthermore, researchers using an API often overlook the substantial in-product features that prioritize the most relevant content. Based on user interests and choices, we limit the visibility of low-quality content using tools such as Quality Filter and Safe Search — both of which are on by default for all of Twitter’s users and active for more than 97% of users. It also notes that researchers have not always correctly identified bots — flagging media reports which it claims have “recently highlighted how users named as bots in research were real people, reinforcing the risks of limited data being used to attribute activity, particularly in the absence of peer review”. Although there have also been media reports of the reverse phenomenon: i.e. Twitter users who were passing themselves off as ‘real people’ (frequently Americans), and accruing lots of retweets, yet who have since been unmasked as Kremlin-controlled disinformation accounts. Such as @SouthLoneStar. Twitter’s letter ends by seeking to play down the political influence of botnets — quoting the conclusion of a City University report that states “we have not found evidence supporting the notion that bots can substantively alter campaign communication”. But again, that study would presumably have been based on the partial view of information diffusion on its platform that Twitter has otherwise complained does not represent the full picture (i.e. in order to downplay other studies that have suggested bots were successfully spreading Brexit-related political disinformation). So really, it can’t have it both ways. (See also: Facebook selling ads on its platform while trying to simultaneously claim the notion that fake news can influence voters is “crazy”.) In its letter to Collins, Twitter does also say it’s “engaged in dialogue with academics and think tanks around the world, including those in the UK, to discuss potential collaboration and to explore where our own efforts can be better shared without jeopardizing their effectiveness or user privacy”. And at least now we don’t have too much longer to wait for its official assessment of the role Russian agents using its platform played in Brexit. Albeit, if Twitter provided full and free access to researchers so that the opinion-influencing impact of its platform could be more robustly studied the company probably still wouldn’t like all the conclusions being drawn. But nor would it so easily be able to downplay them.  \n",

            "33 Facebook prototypes Messenger Broadcast for businesses\n",
            "Facebook  may soon be ready to squeeze more money out of its 1.3 billion-user chat app. The company has internally developed “Messenger Broadcast,” a self-serve mass-messaging interface that lets businesses send marketing messages to users. Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s testing the feature internally, but hadn’t trialed it to the public or with businesses as of late last month. While the company was cagey about the functionality, it appears that businesses design a welcome message, message title and subtitle, and include a call to action to the user such as visiting the business’ website, prompting a Messenger bot or tapping to send a preset reply written by the business. Companies can preview their message within the Messenger Broadcast interface or on Messenger itself.  As for who the message can reach, the interface outlines that a certain number of users will receive it at no cost to the business. It’s unclear whether businesses will be able to pay for more reach, but that seems like a reasonable direction for the product. A Facebook spokesperson told me: “We often test products, features and ideas and are always exploring new ways to make it easier for businesses to deliver great experiences to their customers. Once we’ve tested them internally we make a call as to whether or not to ultimately release them. As such we don’t comment on unreleased features.”  Messenger Broadcast was first spotted by tipster phwd, which was reshared by The Next Web’s Matt Navarra. Facebook has been cautious about monetizing Messenger, lest it hamper its growth. But over the past few years it’s started offering Facebook News Feed “click to message” ads that start conversations with businesses, allowing certain partners to send Sponsored Messages directly to users with the help of Facebook’s ads team, and in July it began globally injecting display ads into the Messenger inbox. Facebook tells me that regardless of what happens with Messenger Broadcast, it has no plans to change the policy of requiring people to have initiated message threads with businesses before they can message the users with ads or otherwise. That means businesses may need to coax users into pinging them first before they can reach them through Messenger Broadcast. Though again, it’s possible this never rolls out. Facebook will need to be careful here if it does launch the product. If Messenger feels spammy, users might not open chats from friends because they’re lost amongst the ads, or flee back to the status quo of SMS. But with Messenger and Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp now the dominant cross-platform messaging apps around the world beyond China, Facebook may finally feel that Messenger is big and dominant enough to start earning its keep.  \n",

            "34 Facebook and The Gates Foundation are matching $2M in donations for #GivingTuesday\n",
            "Today is #GivingTuesday, a global day of giving that always falls on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving. This year Facebook is again partnering with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to match up to $2M in donations to fundraisers held on Facebook by nonprofits. Additionally, Facebook is waiving its typical 5% fee on donations to U.S-based nonprofits all day long. It’s a big step up from last year for both groups, when Facebook only waived fees up to $500,000 and the Gates Foundation only matched $500,000 (but later increased it to $900,000 as the original milestone was hit within hours). Last year on Giving Tuesday Facebook raised $6.79M total via their fundraising platform, and $168M was raised worldwide by all participants. Matching for U.S nonprofits will be capped at $50,000, or $1,000 per fundraiser or donate button until the $2M matching limit is hit. This $1,000 limit means that the most successful nonprofits will have lots of individual fundraisers and donate buttons created by a variety of Facebook users, and not just rely on ones created by themselves. So in additional to actually donating money you can help by creating fundraiser for a nonprofit here, or just add a donate button to a Facebook post by typing #donate. There’s also an option to go live and add a donate button to your live stream, essentially letting you create your own mini-telethon. Matching starts at 8am ET, so if you’re planning on donating to a your favorite charity make sure you do it early in case the matching funds run out.   \n",

            "35 Facebook rolls out AI to detect suicidal posts before they’re reported\n",
            "This is software to save lives. Facebook’s  new “proactive detection” artificial intelligence technology will scan all posts for patterns of suicidal thoughts, and when necessary send mental health resources to the user at risk or their friends, or contact local first-responders. By using AI to flag worrisome posts to human moderators instead of waiting for user reports, Facebook can decrease how long it takes to send help. Facebook previously tested using AI to detect troubling posts and more prominently surface suicide reporting options to friends in the U.S. Now Facebook is will scour all types of content around the world with this AI, except in the European Union, where General Data Protection Regulation privacy laws on profiling users based on sensitive information complicate the use of this tech.  Facebook also will use AI to prioritize particularly risky or urgent user reports so they’re more quickly addressed by moderators, and tools to instantly surface local language resources and first-responder contact info. It’s also dedicating more moderators to suicide prevention, training them to deal with the cases 24/7, and now has 80 local partners like Save.org, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Forefront from which to provide resources to at-risk users and their networks. “This is about shaving off minutes at every single step of the process, especially in Facebook Live,” says VP of product management Guy Rosen. Over the past month of testing, Facebook has initiated more than 100 “wellness checks” with first-responders visiting affected users. “There have been cases where the first-responder has arrived and the person is still broadcasting.” The idea of Facebook proactively scanning the content of people’s posts could trigger some dystopian fears about how else the technology could be applied. Facebook didn’t have answers about how it would avoid scanning for political dissent or petty crime, with Rosen merely saying “we have an opportunity to help here so we’re going to invest in that.” There are certainly massive beneficial aspects about the technology, but it’s another space where we have little choice but to hope Facebook doesn’t go too far. [Update: Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos responded to these concerns with a heartening tweet signaling that Facebook does take seriously responsible use of AI. The creepy/scary/malicious use of AI will be a risk forever, which is why it's important to set good norms today around weighing data use versus utility and be thoughtful about bias creeping in. Also, Guy Rosen and team are amazing, great opportunity for ML engs to have impact. https://t.co/N9trF5X9iM — Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) November 27, 2017  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg praised the product update in a post today, writing that “In the future, AI will be able to understand more of the subtle nuances of language, and will be able to identify different issues beyond suicide as well, including quickly spotting more kinds of bullying and hate.” Unfortunately, after TechCrunch asked if there was a way for users to opt out, of having their posts a Facebook spokesperson responded that users cannot opt out. They noted that the feature is designed to enhance user safety, and that support resources offered by Facebook can be quickly dismissed if a user doesn’t want to see them.] Facebook trained the AI by finding patterns in the words and imagery used in posts that have been manually reported for suicide risk in the past. It also looks for comments like “are you OK?” and “Do you need help?”  “We’ve talked to mental health experts, and one of the best ways to help prevent suicide is for people in need to hear from friends or family that care about them,” Rosen says. “This puts Facebook in a really unique position. We can help connect people who are in distress connect to friends and to organizations that can help them.” Through the combination of AI, human moderators and crowdsourced reports, Facebook could try to prevent tragedies like when a father killed himself on Facebook Live last month. Live broadcasts in particular have the power to wrongly glorify suicide, hence the necessary new precautions, and also to affect a large audience, as everyone sees the content simultaneously unlike recorded Facebook videos that can be flagged and brought down before they’re viewed by many people. Now, if someone is expressing thoughts of suicide in any type of Facebook post, Facebook’s AI will both proactively detect it and flag it to prevention-trained human moderators, and make reporting options for viewers more accessible.  When a report comes in, Facebook’s tech can highlight the part of the post or video that matches suicide-risk patterns or that’s receiving concerned comments. That avoids moderators having to skim through a whole video themselves. AI prioritizes users reports as more urgent than other types of content-policy violations, like depicting violence or nudity. Facebook says that these accelerated reports get escalated to local authorities twice as fast as unaccelerated reports. Mark Zuckerberg gets teary-eyed discussing inequality during his Harvard commencement speech in May Facebook’s tools then bring up local language resources from its partners, including telephone hotlines for suicide prevention and nearby authorities. The moderator can then contact the responders and try to send them to the at-risk user’s location, surface the mental health resources to the at-risk user themselves or send them to friends who can talk to the user. “One of our goals is to ensure that our team can respond worldwide in any language we support,” says Rosen. Back in February, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote that “There have been terribly tragic events — like suicides, some live streamed — that perhaps could have been prevented if someone had realized what was happening and reported them sooner . . .  Artificial intelligence can help provide a better approach.” With more than 2 billion users, it’s good to see Facebook stepping up here. Not only has Facebook created a way for users to get in touch with and care for each other. It’s also unfortunately created an unmediated real-time distribution channel in Facebook Live that can appeal to people who want an audience for violence they inflict on themselves or others. Creating a ubiquitous global communication utility comes with responsibilities beyond those of most tech companies, which Facebook seems to be coming to terms with.  \n",

            "36 Facebook’s ad system shown failing to enforce its own anti-discriminatory policy\n",
            "Can Facebook  be trusted to abide by even its own stated standards? In the case of Internet political advertising the social giant wants to be allowed to continue to self regulate — despite the scandal of Russian bought socially divisive ads which (we now know) were tainting democratic discussion during the 2016 US presidential election (and beyond). ‘Don’t regulate us, we can regulate ourselves — honest!‘ is shaping up to be CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s massively moonshot new year project for 2018. But results from a new ProPublica investigation suggest the tech giant is failing at even simple self-policing — undermining any claims it can responsibly manage the bad and even out-and-out illegal outcomes that are being enabled via its platform, and bolstering the case for more formal regulation. Case in point: A year ago Facebook said it would disable ethnic affinity ad targeting for housing, employment and credit-related ads, following a ProPublica investigation that had suggested the platform’s ad-targeting capabilities could be used for discriminatory advertising — particularly in housing and employment, where such practices are illegal. This month ProPublica checked in again, to see how Facebook is doing — by purchasing dozens of rental housing ads and asking that Facebook’s ad platform exclude groups that are protected from discrimination under the US Federal Fair Housing Act — such as African Americans and Jews. Its test ads promoted a fictional apartment for rent, targeted at people aged 18 to 65 who were living in New York, house hunting and likely to move — with ProPublica narrowing the audience by excluding certain “Behaviors”, listed in a section Facebook now calls “Multicultural Affinity”, including “Hispanic”, “African American” and “Asian American”. However instead of the platform blocking the potentially discriminatory ad buys, ProPublica reports that all its ads were approved by Facebook “within minutes” — including an ad that sought to exclude potential renters “interested in Islam, Sunni Islam and Shia Islam”. It says that ad took the longest to approve of all its buys (22 minutes) — but that all the rest were approved within three minutes. It also successfully bought ads that it judged Facebook’s system should at least flag for self-certification because they were seeking to exclude other members of protected categories. But the platform just accepted housing ads blocked from being shown to categories including ‘soccer moms’, people interested in American sign language, gay men and people interested in wheelchair ramps. Yet, back in February, Facebook announced new “stronger” anti-discriminatory ad polices, saying it was deploying machine learning tech tools to help it identify ads in the categories of concern. “We’ve updated our policies to make our existing prohibition against discrimination even stronger. We make it clear that advertisers may not discriminate against people based on personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, family status, disability, medical or genetic condition,” it wrote then. Of the new tech tools, Facebook said: “This will allow us to more quickly provide notices and educational information to advertisers — and more quickly respond to violations of our policy.” Explaining how the new system would work, Facebook said advertisers who attempt to show “an ad that we identify as offering a housing, employment or credit opportunity” and which “either includes or excludes our multicultural advertising segments — which consist of people interested in seeing content related to the African American, Asian American and US Hispanic communities” will find the platform disapproves the ad. The new system would also require all advertisers that attempt to buy targeted advertising in the categories of concern to self-certify they are complying with Facebook’s anti-discrimination policies and with “applicable anti-discrimination laws”. ProPublica says it never even encountered these self-certification screens, as well as never having any of its ad buys blocked. “Under its own policies, Facebook should have flagged these ads, and prevented the posting of some of them. Its failure to do so revives questions about whether the company is in compliance with federal fair housing rules, as well as about its ability and commitment to police discriminatory advertising on the world’s largest social network,” it writes. Responding to ProPublica’s findings, Facebook sent a statement attributed to Ami Vora, VP of product management, in which she concedes its system failed in this instance. “This was a failure in our enforcement and we’re disappointed that we fell short of our commitments. The rental housing ads purchased by ProPublica should have but did not trigger the extra review and certifications we put in place due to a technical failure,” said Vora. She went on to claim Facebook’s anti-discrimination system had “successfully flagged millions of ads” in the credit, employment and housing categories — but also said Facebook will now begin requiring self-certification for ads in all categories that choose to exclude an audience segment. “Our systems continue to improve but we can do better,” she added. The latter phrase is now a very familiar refrain from Facebook where content review and moderation is concerned. Aside from socially divisive political disinformation, it has faced growing criticism this year for enabling the spread of content such as extremist propaganda and child exploitation, as well as for multiple incidents of its tools being used to broadcast suicides and murders. The wider question for governments and regulators is at what point will Facebook’s attempts to ‘do better’ be deemed just not good enough? Commenting on ProPublica’s findings in a statement, Rachel Goodman, an attorney with the ACLU‘s Racial Justice Program, said: “We’re very, very disappointed to see these significant failures in Facebook’s system for identifying and preventing discrimination in advertisements for rental housing. We and other advocates spent many hours helping Facebook move toward solving the egregious discrimination problem built into its ad targeting business — that advertisers could exclude people from seeing ads based on race, gender, and religion, including in ads for housing, credit, and employment. Facebook’s representations to us indicated that this problem had been substantially solved, but it now seems clear that was not the case. “While we appreciate that Facebook continues to express a desire to get it right on this important civil rights issue, this story highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability. Had outside researchers been able to see and the system Facebook created to catch these ads, those researchers could have spotted this problem and ended the mechanism for discrimination sooner.” This story was updated with additional comment from the ACLU  \n",

            "It’s been a while since my Facebook  notifications feed was filled to the brim with invites to play FarmVille, but I’ve been reminded every so often at how awful those times were. It seems that tool for growing an app’s audience is not long for this world as Facebook has announced that App Invites, alongside a bunch of other developer integrations, will be sunsetting over the next few months. These features, which also include the Native Like Button, App Links Host, Comment Mirroring, Send Button, Sharing Insights and Follow Button products, are going to be shut down February 6 “in order for [Facebook] to build new products for [their] developer community.” With Facebook’s 4.28 SDK version, App Invites are done and there doesn’t seem to immediately be another replacement coming for developers who relied on the tool. Comment mirroring is another feature getting the boot, if you had it enabled. It allowed Facebook comments to appear on pieces of content offsite that used the plug-in; now those comments will only live on the big FB itself. The Sharing Insights tab lived inside Facebook Analytics and has previously been a pretty significant way for Page admins to get their hands on some of the more broad trends regarding demographics of users that were sharing their content.  The Native Like Button for Android and iOS mobile apps allowed companies to hop into people’s Facebook feeds without even requiring them to leave the site or app they were on. Now alongside the loss of widgets like the Follow Button it seems like Facebook is done giving away freebies and wants companies and organizations to think of their Facebook page as their central home and treat it accordingly. One trend from many of these features is that Facebook is paring down the connection between its site and the web at large as many of these products sought to enrich outside experience and may only be detracting from core experiences buried inside Facebook at this moment. These features are living on for 90 days, but no longer.  \n",

            "38 Facebook launches Creator app for influencers to build video communities\n",
            "Facebook  wants to turn mindless, passive video consumption into “time well spent,” and now it’s giving social media stars a powerful tool to foster communities around their content. Today Facebook launches Facebook Creator, offering influencers Live Creative Kit for adding intros and outros to broadcasts, a unified inbox of Facebook and Instagram comments plus Messenger chats, cross-posting to Twitter and expansive analytics. Facebook promised the Creator app back in June at VidCon and today it launches globally on iOS with Android planned for the coming months. It’s actually a rebrand and update of the 2014 Facebook Mentions app that was only available to verified public figures and Pages, but now is open to everyone. Weirdly, it still appears as “Mentions” in the App Store for now. Any individual profile or Page can download Creator for access to the enhanced fan engagement tools. Facebook is also launching a Facebook for Creators website with best practices for growing fan bases, examples of what other stars are doing and access to answers of frequently asked questions. “It’s a big priority for us to bring people closer together around meaningful content and the people who are meaningful to them,” Facebook’s VP of video product Fidji Simo tells me. “Creators are right at the intersection of everything we think is pretty unique about Facebook.” And after CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared on this month’s earnings call that “time well spent” via video is Facebook’s new objective, the Creator app could help it make Facebook video a lot less isolating than watching TV.  “The idea was there to give them a one-stop-shop for all the functionality to manage their presence on the go,” Simo explains about the Creator app, which breaks down into four parts. Live Creative Kit This bundle of tools lets users add intros, outros and custom emoji reactions to their live broadcasts. Creators go on Facebook’s site, upload an intro like a theme song or welcome, and an outro like a call to follow them across social media. Those can then be enabled in the Creator app so they play at the start and end of the broadcast. Simo notes that “[Creators] were saying Live is cool because it’s raw and authentic, but they’d like to be able to introduce every time what their show is about or what the theme is about.” Graph frames let makers add a pretty border to their videos for a more immersive feel. And custom reactions let creators replace one of the six default “haha,” “‘angry” or “wow” alternatives to the standard “Like” with a graphic of their choice. That could tie in with the theme of their broadcast or personality. For example, Simo says feel-good video star Markian could add an especially toothy smile reaction to entertain his fan club group on Facebook, the #SmileSquad. These features push Facebook Live well beyond the capabilities of Twitter’s Periscope, and could make it more viable than YouTube Live. Unified inbox Rather than having to constantly jump between Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, Facebook is putting all of a creator’s comments and messages in a single inbox with Creator. That could make it much more streamlined to actually hold a conversation with fans or respond to comments instead of just being an old-school one-way broadcaster. For Creators trying to moderate their comments reels, combining Instagram and Facebook could reduce the time it takes to scrub abusive trolls. And the more ravenous the community and clean the comments, the more interested brands will be to advertise on Facebook video and sponsor the stars. Stories and Camera To keep the focus on Facebook’s augmented reality and daily sharing features, access to Facebook Camera and Stories sharing is available from Creator. Facebook will even let people cross-post to Instagram and even Twitter to reduce the friction of putting their content everywhere. That simplicity could encourage people to build higher-quality content and keep Facebook in the sharing loop. Analytics Creators need to know what’s working so they can make more of it. Rather than burying that inside their Facebook Pages, Facebook is surfacing inside the Creator app. Details on fan demographics could help influencers not only zero in on what types of videos they should post, but also what brands might want to sponsor them. You might disagree with Facebook’s definition of “time well spent.” But even if it’s just modest social interaction around video, that might be a marked improvement from vegging out on the couch binging Netflix or endlessly lurking through the News Feed. What’s missing: monetization The Creator app could lure social media stars away from competitors like their long-standing home YouTube with its Studio app for creators, their subscription revenue hub Patreon or Snapchat, which this month announced it’s ready to embrace influencers. By using the personalities of individual creators to forge deeper bonds with viewers, Facebook could rack up extra lucrative video ad impressions. But one thing sorely missing from Facebook Creator is new ways for influencers to monetize. There’s no subscriptions or tipping, and they can’t even inject revenue-sharing ad breaks into their videos. The only option is to post sponsored, branded content and label it with Facebook’s partnership tagging feature. At least Simo says “it’s not a one size fits all when it comes to monetization. [Creators] all need a lot of different things. We’re open to exploring a lot of different business models but on that front nothing to announce at this time.” One other thing Facebook could do better here is an integration with Groups. More and more stars are launching Facebook Groups around their content so fans can not only interact with them, but so they can interact with each other. Facebook should make it easier to start, grow and nurture fan clubs from the Creator app. Facebook has an enormous opportunity in this space. Unlike YouTube, where people go when they want to be entertained, people just constantly visit Facebook to see their friends. By both serendipitously helping these users discover creators and providing the dedicated Watch video tab for following them, Facebook dangles its 2 billion users in front of influencers, recruiting those eager to grow their followings. And for the user, facilitating two-way connections with creators helps Facebook achieve its mission of making video the focal point of community rather than an escape from it.  \n",

            "39 Facebook, Google and others join The Trust Project, an effort to increase transparency around online news\n",
            "“Fake news” and other misinformation, online propaganda, and satirical content people believe is true have filled the web via search engines and social media, and have caused a rift in how people perceive today’s news organizations and the quality of their coverage. A nonpartisan effort called The Trust Project is working to address this situation by helping online users distinguish between reliable journalism and promotional content or misinformation. Today, a key part of that effort – called “Trust Indicators” – are going live on Facebook,  offering easy-to-access, transparent information about a news organization’s ethics and practices. Here’s how this will work in practice: starting today on Facebook, an icon will appear next to articles in the News Feed. When you click on this icon, you can read information the publisher has shared related to their organization’s “ethics and other standards, the journalists’ backgrounds, and how they do their work,” according to an announcement from The Trust Project.  Facebook, Google,  Bing and Twitter have all committed to displaying these indicators, though not all implementations are yet live. On Google, the Trust Indicators will appear within Google News, Google Search, and in other Google products where news is found, the company explained in a blog post today. However, Google says it’s still determining how exactly the Indicators will be displayed.  The Trust Project itself was started by journalist Sally Lehrman of Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, and is funded by Craigslist founder Craig Newmark’s Philanthropic Fund, Google, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Democracy Fund, and the Markkula Foundation. “In today’s digitized and socially networked world, it’s harder than ever to tell what’s accurate reporting, advertising, or even misinformation,” Lehrman said, in a statement. “An increasingly skeptical public wants to know the expertise, enterprise and ethics behind a news story. The Trust Indicators put tools into people’s hands, giving them the means to assess whether news comes from a credible source they can depend on.” Specifically, The Trust Project has released eight Trust Indicators created by leaders from over 75 news organizations that will offer additional transparency about an organization’s ethics and practices. These are as follows: Best Practices: What Are Your Standards? Who funds the news outlet? What is the outlet’s mission? Plus commitments to ethics, diverse voices, accuracy, making corrections and other standards. Author Expertise: Who Reported This? Details about the journalist who wrote the story, including expertise and other stories they have worked on. Type of Work: What Is This? Labels to distinguish opinion, analysis and advertiser (or sponsored) content from news reports. Citations and References: For investigative or in-depth stories, greater access to the sources behind the facts and assertions. Methods:  Also for in-depth stories, information about why reporters chose to pursue a story and how they went about the process. Locally Sourced? Lets people know when the story has local origin or expertise. Diverse Voices: A newsroom’s efforts to bring in diverse perspectives. Actionable Feedback: A newsroom’s efforts to engage the public’s help in setting coverage priorities, contributing to the reporting process, ensuring accuracy and other areas. The first news organizations to adopt the Trust Indicators are going live this month, including The German press agency dpa, The Economist, The Globe and Mail, the Independent Journal Review, Mic, Italy’s La Repubblica and La Stampa, Trinity Mirror and The Washington Post. Haymarket Media Group will implement the indicators on three brands by year-end, and several more outlets will begin to display the indicators over the next six months. On Facebook, publishers including Vox Media (select sites) and the AP are involved in its tests, but didn’t disclose the full list of publishers. A WordPress plugin will also be available for qualified publishers. The rallying cry of “fake news,” led by President Trump, has helped to erode some U.S. citizens’ trust in the media. Today, only one-third of Americans say they have either a “great deal” or “fair” amount of trust in news media, according to a Gallup poll. But this is not a problem that’s limited to the U.S. In the U.K., only 43 percent of people in a in a 2017 Reuters Institute said news could be trusted, a sizable drop from the year prior. Similar problems are experienced elsewhere, as well. That’s why The Trust Project’s efforts are not U.S.-only – it’s working in collaboration with a consortium of news organizations worldwide. The Trust Project’s efforts follow related attempts from major tech companies, like Facebook and Google, to handle the problems with the spread of misinformation and propaganda across their platforms. Facebook and Google have both adopted fact-checking initiatives and other efforts in recent months, but these have been criticized as being “too little, too late,” to solve the problem. Misinformation can still go viral, while fake news writers can simply change URLs to avoid the “disputed” tag for their debunked content. And some early surveys show that the efforts may even be causing harm, as it stories without tags – even if false – are believed to be true, The Guardian recently reported. The Trust Project’s Trust Indicators are a different matter, of course. Instead of labeling content as disputed, they’re allowing users to learn more about the organization behind the news and come to their own conclusions about the content. Whether it will actually help in the long-run, of course, remains to be seen.  \n",

            "Facebook  is no stranger when it comes to open sourcing its computing knowledge. Over the years, it has consistently created software and hardware internally, then transferred that wisdom to the open source community to let them have it. Today, it announced it was open sourcing its modular network routing software called Open/R, as the tradition continues. Facebook obviously has unique scale needs when it comes to running a network. It has billions of users doing real-time messaging and streaming content at a constant clip. As with so many things, Facebook found that running the network traffic using traditional protocols had its limits and it needed a new way to route traffic that didn’t rely on the protocols of the past, “Open/R is a distributed networking application platform. It runs on different parts of the network. Instead of relying on protocols for networking routing, it gives us flexibility to program and control a large variety of modern networks,” Omar Baldonado, Engineering Director at Facebook explained. While it was originally developed for Facebook’s Terragraph wireless backhaul network, the company soon recognized it could work on other networks too including the Facebook network backbone, and even in the middle of Facebook network, he said. Given the company’s extreme traffic requirements where the conditions were changing so rapidly and was at such scale, they needed a new way to route traffic on the network. “We wanted to find per application, the best path, taking into account dynamic traffic conditions throughout the network,” Baldonado said. But Facebook also recognized that it could only take this so far internally, and if they could work with partners and other network operators and hardware manufacturers, they could extend the capabilities of this tool. They are in fact working with other companies in this endeavor including Juniper and Arista networks, but by open sourcing the software, it allows developers to do things with it that Facebook might not have considered, and their engineering team finds that prospect both exciting and valuable. It’s also part of a growing trend at Facebook (and other web scale companies) to open up more and more of the networking software and hardware. These companies need to control every aspect of the process that they can, and building software like this, then giving it to the open source community lets others bring their expertise and perspective and improve the original project. “This goes along with movement toward disaggregation of the network. If you open up the hardware and open up the software on top of it, it benefits everyone,” Baldonado said.  \n",

            "41 Facebook says Russia did try to meddle in Brexit vote\n",
            "BuzzFeed has obtained a statement from Facebook in which the tech giant admits, for the first time, that some Russia-linked accounts may have used its platform to try to interfere in the UK’s European Union referendum vote in June 2016. Which means Russian agents weren’t just using Facebook  to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election, and in other recent elections in the West — such as those in France and Germany. Elections are of course a huge deal but the result can at least be reversed at the ballot box in time. The in/out Brexit referendum in the UK was no such standard vote. And there is no standard process for reversing the result. So if Kremlin agents also used Facebook to influence people in the UK to vote for Brexit that would be hugely significant — and further evidence that social media’s connective tissue can be used to drive and inflame societal divisions. “To date, we have not observed that the known, coordinated clusters in Russia engaged in significant coordination of ad buys or political misinformation targeting the Brexit vote,” a Facebook spokesperson told BuzzFeed in a carefully worded statement. Which begs the question how much Russian Facebook activity did target the Brexit vote?  We asked Facebook how many socially divisive Russian-backed ads ran before Brexit. Facebook declined to comment. While its claim not to have found “significant coordination” of Russian activity ahead of the Brexit vote might sound like ‘case closed’ on the EU referendum front, the company has consistently sought to play down the impact of Facebook-distributed Russian misinformation — with CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially describing it as a “pretty crazy idea” that fake news could have influenced voters in the US election. Nearly half a year later, after conducting an internal investigation, Facebook conceded there had been a Russian disinformation campaign during the US election — but claimed the reach of the operation was “statistically very small” in comparison with overall political activity and engagement. Then in September another tidbit came out when it said it now believed potential pro-Kremlin entities could have spent up to $150,000 on its platform to buy 3,000 ads to between 2015 and 2017. It said the ads were tied to 470 accounts — some linked to a known Russian troll farm called the Internet Research Agency. It also agreed to share the Russian backed US political ads with congressional investigators looking into US election-related disinformation. Though it rejected calls to make all the ads public. Finally, at the end of last month, about a year after its CEO’s denial of the potency of political disinformation on his mega platform, Facebook admitted Russian-backed content could have reached as many as 126 million people in the US. It now estimates the number of pieces of divisive content at 80,000, after being asked by congressional investigators to report not just direct Russian-bought ads but organic posts, images, events and more, which can also of course become viral vehicles of disinformation on Facebook’s algorithmically driven platform. So there’s a reason to be cautious about accepting at face value the company’s claim now that Russian Brexit meddling existed on its platform but was not significant. Giving a speech yesterday, the UK prime minister set out in no uncertain tones her conviction that Russia has been using social media platforms to try to interfere with Western democracies, directly accusing Vladimir Putin of seeking to sow social division by “weaponizing information” and planting fake stories. Multiple Twitter accounts previously linked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency have also been identified as engaging in Brexit-related tweeting, according to the Times — linking Russian-backed election meddling troll activity to the UK’s EU referendum vote too. On Friday, Wired detailed some of the Russian-backed Twitter accounts and 2016 Brexit-related tweets — including tweets apparently seeking to conflate Islam with terrorism, and others aiming to stir up anti-immigrant sentiment such as by spreading racial slurs. We asked Twitter how many accounts it has linked to pro-Kremlin entities that were also tweeting about Brexit ahead of the referendum vote. At the time of writing the company had not responded. Meanwhile Russia continues to amuse itself with a spot of public Twitter trolling of the UK PM… The Russian Foreign Ministry's official Twitter account is trolling our prime minister. Can someone explain what this means? Hybrid warfare's over? We're now deep into postmodern warfare? pic.twitter.com/la97GLe7BL — Carole Cadwalladr (@carolecadwalla) November 14, 2017  A UK parliamentary committee which is investigating fake news has previously requested data from Twitter and Facebook on Russian accounts which posted about the EU referendum. Commenting on the cache of Russian tweets now linked to Brexit, Damian Collins, the MP leading the inquiry, told Wired: “I think it shows that Russian-controlled accounts have been politically active in the UK as well as America. This could just be the tip of the iceberg because we’ve only really just started looking and doing a proper detailed study of what accounts linked to Russian organisations have been doing politically.” The UK’s Brexit vote was both a shock result and a close one, with 51.9 per cent voting to leave the EU vs 48.1 per cent voting remain. It caused huge immediate political upheaval — with the then UK Prime Minister resigning immediately. There was also major drop in the value of pound sterling. (The pound remains down around 11 per cent vs the dollar and 15 per cent vs the euro.) While Brexit-based uncertainty continues to impact almost every aspect of day-to-day political activity in the UK, given the scale of the task facing ministers to try to unpick more than 40 years of EU agreements — clearly deflecting the government from being able to pursue a wider policy agenda as ministers’ fixed firefighting focus is on trying to enact Brexit without causing even greater disruption to UK businesses and citizens. Scores of European ministers and civil servants are also having to expend further resources to manage Brexit vis-a-vis their own sets of priorities and to shape whatever comes after. The incentive for Russia to have sought to run a disinformation campaign to encourage disunity in the European Union by encouraging a vote for Brexit is clear: Instability weakens your opponents. Whether Putin’s agents were merely dabbling with Brexit disinformation as they geared up for a more major disinformation push focused on the US election remains to be seen. But given the closeness of the Brexit vote — and the long term disruption Brexit will undoubtedly cause — then any Russia-backed interference deserves to be quantified in full. So we’re all looking at you, Facebook.  \n",

            "42 Facebook launches collaborative Stories for Groups and Events\n",
            "Facebook  is combining its Snapchat Stories clone with features Snapchat can’t match in a bid to boost usage. Starting today, users of Facebook Groups and Events will be able to contribute to a Facebook Story visible to the rest of the members and moderated by the admins. This could be fun for parties, weddings, meetups and more. In essence, these collaborative Stories will work like a private hashtag so multiple people can add content but only those involved can see it. Facebook product manager Connor Hayes tells me the features “Give multiple people the opportunity to tell a Story from multiple different angles.” People will see Stories on their Event and Group pages, as well as atop their News Feed. They’ll be able to post while inside Events and Groups, or get the option to share there on the Facebook Stories share sheet. Snapchat has its own private groups feature, but this is more akin to a group chat thread you can send Stories to. Facebook is enabling Groups around hobbies, professions, ideologies and locations to create niche Stories content that might not appeal to friends but is appealing to fellow members with a particular interest. You can see how collaborative Event Stories work in the video below:  Meanwhile, Facebook is also launching Facebook Stories for its stripped app for the developing world, Facebook Lite. For now, users on the low-data-usage version of Facebook’s main app can only view Stories, but the company tells me posting is coming soon. The announcements come alongside a big overhaul of Facebook’s Stories products. It’s replacing Messenger Day with Facebook Stories, and syncing both cross-posting and viewing. It’s also killing off the Facebook Direct ephemeral messaging feature in favor of handling Stories replies and messages via Messenger.  Facebook Stories posts will follow rules set by admins for the standard wall posts. So admins can either allow posts from everyone and delete ones they don’t like, or they can require approvals of posts. And to encourage people to kick off a Story, Facebook will show an open bubble atop the News Feed for you to add to if you’re RSVP’d for an event happening right now. By integrating Stories with Events and Groups, Facebook has gone beyond copying Snapchat. And it’s proving that it’s serious about Stories for the long-run. Rather than just bolting on Stories, its intermingling the feature across the Facebook app. That could create sharing opportunities Snapchat lacks, spur usage by different demographics and encourage original content sharing rather than generic link sharing.  \n",

            "43 Facebook relaunches Events app as Facebook Local, adds bars and food\n",
            "Bad news for Yelp and good news for nightlife lovers. When you want to go out, it doesn’t necessarily have to be to an event. So to help you discover bars, restaurants, and nearby attractions, Facebook  is rebranding its standalone Events app as “Facebook Local”. Launching in the U.S. today on iOS and Android, Facebook Local combines events and permanent places to a single search engine powered by Facebook’s 70 million business pages plus reviews and friends’ checkins. Facebook Local product manager Aditya Koolwal tells me the goal was to “Make it a lot easier to do certain kind of looks ups that are very common when making plans with friends.” Easier is key, considering Facebook Events never made it above #139 on the social networking app charts and SensorTower estimates it only got 100,000 downloads. For now, he tells me Facebook Local won’t feature ads from businesses and events trying to stand out, but says “we’ll think about advertising way further down the line.” Back inside Facebook’s main app, the Nearby feature that’s buried in the More tab is getting rebranded as “Local” too. But there, it’s still separate from Facebook Events. While Koolwal says he hasn’t thought about it, the Facebook Local app could one day be a good home for Facebook’s Nearby Friends, which shows real-time locations of your friends similar to Snapchat’s Snap Map. Facebook’s recently launched Order Food feature could also be a smart addition if you and friends decide leaving the house is too much work.  Facebook first launched the Events app just over a year ago to help that one friend who rallies everyone to go out and figure out where. It was useful for seeing Event invites and wall posts in one place, and seeing nearby happenings on a certain day. But it was a bit buggy, redundant with the main Facebook app’s event feature, and ruled out places that were fun every night rather than just when they threw parties. Facebook Local could help you pick between great bars on a block, and find out if one has a band playing. Here’s how the app works: Facebook Local’s home page shows shortcuts to see nearby restaurants, cafes, drinks, attractions, and more, as well as where friends and people you follow go. You’ll see a calendar of your day’s Events, a Trending Events feed, guides to music, nightlife, art, and other happenings, and options to see everything going on certain days.  A Discover feed shows top suggestions and what’s popular with friends. And a Calendar tab lays out all your Event invites and RSVPs, and you can import your phone’s calendars to have everything in one spot. If you’re travelling, Facebook Local lets you change your location to see what’s up in another city. For now, you can’t order directly from Local like with the Facebook app’s Order Food feature, but restaurant Pages do sometimes include a link to a deliverer like Grubhub. Even if you don’t use the standalone Facebook Local app, you’ll still benefit. Koolwal tells me Facebook and Local share the same code, so when it improves something like the ability to search for ‘cappuccino’ not just ‘cafes’, those “enhancements reflect back to Facebook immediately.” If Facebook actually promotes the Facebook Local app, it could become a legitimate alternative to Yelp or Foursquare, using both Facebook’s wide range of local business data with your social graph and user generated content like photos and reviews. That in turn could convince businesses to invest more in their Facebook Pages, turn all their offline happenings into Facebook Events, and seek more social content from their customers. Facebook’s new mission is “Bringing the world closer together” and few things do that as vividly as nightlife. The company is often criticized for supposedly isolating people, but there’s no replacement for Facebook Events. When I hear people considering deleting their Facebook account, it’s often Events that they stay for. By bundling these with local business listings, Facebook could finally give Events the spotlight they deserve.  \n",

            "Facebook’s  social good team has launched a donate button specific to crises. The goal is that people will be able to more easily and securely help communities affected by natural disasters. Facebook already has a Crisis Response hub with crisis pages. Now, when you click on the crisis page, you’ll see the option to donate right at the top of the screen. Facebook says it will not charge any fees for donations made through the Crisis donation button. Facebook is doing this in partnership with GlobalGiving, a non-profit organization that collects and sends fund to local organizations that are able to help during times of disaster. Facebook’s Safety Check had already integrated fundraisers back in June, but those have a 6.9 percent plus $.30 fee that goes to payment processing, fundraiser vetting, and security and fraud protection. “Following a disaster, people in the affected area often have tremendous needs to help them recover and rebuild, while others who aren’t affected want to help communities in any way they can,” Facebook Social Good Product Manager Asha Sharma said in a statement. “Our goal at Facebook is to create tools that make it easier for people to help their community and the communities they care about recover from a crisis.”  \n",

            "45 Facebook defends revenge porn pilot that has people upload nude images of themselves\n",
            "Facebook  Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis has clarified some things about how Facebook’s test pilot to combat revenge porn in Australia works. The strategy entails uploading your nude photos or videos to Messenger in order to help Facebook tag it as non-consensual explicit media. “With this new small pilot, we want to test an emergency option for people to provide a photo proactively to Facebook, so it never gets shared in the first place,” Davis wrote. “This program is completely voluntary. It’s a protective measure that can help prevent a much worse scenario where an image is shared more widely.” Facebook is doing this in partnership with Australian government agency eSafety in order to try to prevent people from sharing intimate images without consent. If someone fears they are at risk of revenge porn, they can contact eSafety. The organization might then tell them to send a nude photo of themselves to themselves via Messenger. Facebook’s hashing system would then be able to recognize those images in the future without needing to store them on its servers. In her post, Davis clarifies that eSafety does not have access to the actual image. However, a “specially trained representative from [Facebook’s] Community Operations team” does need to first review the image before hashing it. Once the image has been hashed, Facebook notifies the person who submitted the photo and asks them to delete the photo from Messenger. At that point, Facebook will delete the image from its servers. Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos says that while there are some risks involved with people self-reporting their photos, “it’s a risk we are trying to balance against the serious, real-world harm that occurs every day when people (mostly women) can’t stop NCII from being posted,” he wrote on Twitter. NCII is short for non-consensual intimate imagery. Stamos went on to say that Facebook takes steps to protect the data and only retains non-reversible hashes. Some critics, however, suggest a better method would be one that doesn’t require uploading the image in the first place. One suggestion is to hash the image locally and then upload the hash to determine a match. It’s also not clear if this is age-gated to prevent minors from sending their photos. Stamos responded to the idea to calculate the hash locally, saying “photo fingerprinting algorithms are usually not included in clients to prevent the development of circumvention techniques” and “humans need to review to prevent adversarial reporting.”  \n",

            "The Essential  Phone just got a camera software update that will allow owners of the device to broadcast live, 360-degree video right from the native camera app, provided they have the Essential 360 Camera, too. The update requires no extra software, and live streaming becomes available as soon as you snap the 360 camera onto the magnetic accessory port on the back of the Essential Phone. Snapping on the camera will boot up the camera app as before, in 360 mode, and then you can either tap the 360-degree Live option, or just swipe left to switch to that mode. On first use, you’ll have to tap that red “Live” camera button to login to your Facebook account, and then enable permissions for posting to your account. After that, you can choose the reach of your broadcasts, including the standard Facebook sharing options of “Only me, Friends, Friends of Friend and Public.” Users can also fill in a description of their stream if they want to, and then tap that red icon once again to get to actually streaming. After this initial process, you’ll be authenticated for future streams. Essential clearly has a strong belief in the potential of 360-degree media. I spoke to the team about it being their debut accessory for the modular connector on the Essential Phone’s back, and it’s clear they think that getting ahead of the curve for creating and sharing 360 content quickly and easily will position them well in future. The Essential 360 Camera and Phone combo now probably also represents the easiest possible way to get streaming live in 360-degrees with Facebook, so we’ll see if that strikes a chord with users.  \n",

            "47 Facebook will teach the unemployed digital/social media skills in 30 cities\n",
            "Whether it’s to “bring the world closer together” or improve its public image, Facebook  today announced Community Boost. Facebook tells me it’s investing tens of millions of dollars into the program that will travel to 30 cities around the U.S. in 2018. It will teach digital job skills to the unemployed, internet literacy to those just getting online, startup methodology to entrepreneurs and customer growth to small business owners. Unsurprisingly, though, all these skills revolve around Facebook, which Facebook clearly thinks is the key to a better life. Stops on the tour include Houston, St. Louis, Albuquerque, Des Moines and Greenville, South Carolina — which are conspicuously all red states that voted for Trump in the 2016 election. Perhaps Facebook hopes to reduce unemployment that led to the dissatisfaction with current political systems which landed us Trump. Facebook cites research by Morning Consult indicating “62% percent of US small businesses using Facebook said having digital or social media skills is an important factor in their hiring decisions — even more important than where a candidate went to school.” Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner says that “We’re happy to welcome Facebook to Houston to boost our residents’ digital skills and make sure our vibrant community of entrepreneurs and small businesses gets more out of the internet.”  The program might be perceived as less self-serving if Facebook had concentrated on teaching skills beyond it site, like how to make a good-looking resume or handle job interviews. So while the intention behind Facebook Community Boost might be honest, it’s tough to interpret it as altruistic while Facebook is amidst congressional hearings into election interference on its platform and is toying with the entire journalism industry as it sucks out ad dollars and jobs. Here’s a look at Facebook’s plans for the program, with the parts where people learn to better use Facebook bolded. If you’re looking for a job, we’ll provide training to help you improve your digital and social media skills. According to the research, 62% percent of US small businesses using Facebook said having digital or social media skills is an important factor in their hiring decisions — even more important than where a candidate went to school. If you’re an entrepreneur, we’ll have training programs on how to use technology to turn an idea into a business or show you ways to create a free online presence using Facebook. If you’re a business owner we’re going to offer ways your business can expand its digital footprint and find new customers around the corner and around the globe. If you’re getting online for the first time or you want to support your community, we’ll provide training on digital literacy and online safety. And we’ll also help community members use technology to bring people together, with features like Events and Groups. All that said, it’s hard to imagine any of the other tech giants like Google, Apple or Amazon pouring resources into something so directly tied to improving people’s socioeconomic mobility. Similar to Mark Zuckerberg’s 2017 challenge to meet people from every U.S. state that finished today in Missouri, you can either see it as just publicity, or as Facebook legitimately wanting to get out and hear from its constituency. Users can request Community Boost come to their city by filling out this form. “One of the things I’m most proud of is that 70 million small businesses use Facebook to connect with customers,” writes Zuckerberg about today’s announcement. “That’s 70 million people who now have access to the same tools the big guys have. Now we need to make it easier for people to start and build new businesses or find jobs and opportunities, and in the process strengthen their communities.”  Facebook tells me it’s invested more than $1 billion into supporting small businesses since 2011 through programs like Boost Your Business classes, which teaches social media management, and the Blueprint online learning hub that 1 million businesses have looked to for social marketing skills. Facebook also is building a digital marketing curriculum to train 3,000 Michiganders in the next two years. [Update: Facebook contacted me after I published this story to emphasize that “Facebook Community Boost will provide more than just training on Facebook.” One way it plans to do that is through partnerships with tech training schools for adults and coding bootcamps like Grand Circus in Michigan. These could help people go beyond basic social media skills and get actual computer science education.] It will take a lot more to convince people Facebook is a benevolent force in the world. Even though its heart is often in the right place, Facebook has demonstrated an inability to predict the misuse and negative secondary impacts of its platform or do enough preemptively to prevent these problems. But if it wants to mend the rift in U.S. society, getting more people employed is a good start.  \n",

            "Facebook  today announced its expanding its Marketplace listings section to include “hundreds of thousands” of housing rentals in a move that seems clearly designed to take on Craigslist. While users before could post their own apartment listings to this section, Facebook says it’s now partnering with sources like Apartment List and Zumper to pull in listings. These partners will work with brokers, agents and other property managers to fill out the expanded housing section. In addition, searchers will be able to filter the housing listings via a number of options, like location, price, rental type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, pet-friendliness and more. Meanwhile, those who want to post their listings to the site can now do so using 360-degree photos. Marketplace continues to be a big focus for Facebook which is intent on turning its social network into a portal for everything you do online or in apps, whether that’s checking the weather or sports scores, buying movie tickets, ordering food, searching for jobs, watching videos, playing games, and more. The end result of all these efforts is that users increase their time on site (or in app), which allows Facebook to collect more data and display more ads. Most recently, Facebook upgraded Marketplace to include used car ads, including those posted by people and from dealerships like Edmunds, Cars.com, Auction123, CDK Global, and SocialDealer. Since January 1, 2017, Facebook says search volume for the Marketplace tab has grown 3x worldwide. The new addition of vehicles and now, rentals, were driven by how people were using the service, the company notes.

            "DST Global,  the investment firm led by Yuri Milner, has sent a letter to its limited partners blasting media outlets for “insinuations” that it used its holdings in Twitter and Facebook as anything other than financial investments, after it was revealed that the Russian government was indirectly an investor in DST Global. The letter, provided to TechCrunch by a source, comes in the wake of a heated period for both companies, along with Google. The three are being questioned by the U.S. Senate, the UK government and the general public over what role Russians may have played in using their platforms to influence outcomes in elections and other democratic processes. Dated November 6, the letter was written one day after the New York Times and the Guardian published articles about the connections between the Russian government and DST Global’s LPs based on data from the Paradise Papers, leaked offshore account information compiled by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The letter underscores how charged the climate is right now for Russian relations with Western countries; how that is playing out on social media platforms with more attention paid to the money that is channeled through them in the form of advertising and investments; and how the media is hunting for more connections between all three. DST Global is one of the tech world’s most prominent global investment firms, with some $7 billion currently invested in a range of tech companies, including consumer internet giants Airbnb and Spotify. Sending out a letter to LPs stating its position was an essential move to shore up support from any LPs who might be wondering what is going on, keeping any chilling effects at bay; and also to make sure that LPs understand that their identities will be protected, as fund LPs are not regularly disclosed. “There have been a number of media articles published today that have sensationalized some older and long-ago exited investments in Twitter and Facebook, omitting many relevant facts as well as the historical context,” the letter notes. “In some publications, DST Global was accused of not disclosing its limited partners to Facebook and Twitter. This is customary in the private equity and venture capital industries, and DST Global did not disclose its LPs to any of the 30+ portfolio companies in which we invested, including Facebook and Twitter.” We have embedded the full letter below. Earlier this week, the media reported that DST Global, the investment firm run by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, had received money from the Kremlin through state-backed businesses, including the publicly listed financial institution VTB Bank, which is majority owned by the Russian government. That money was in turn used to finance early investments rounds in Facebook and Twitter, stakes in which Milner’s companies owned more than 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, at one point. Milner and DST Global divested shares in both Twitter and Facebook after their public offerings. It had sold the last of its Facebook holdings in 2013 and its Twitter shares in 2014. Notably, it isn’t illegal for foreign, state-owned institutions to invest in U.S. companies, either. Still, even a hint of further Russian interference is a more-than-prickly subject right now in light of earlier revelations that Facebook and Twitter both showed thousands of ads planted by fake Russian accounts to foment division within the U.S. during the 2016 Presidential election. It’s widely believed that the ads — in addition to a much wider disinformation campaign that included fake Facebook accounts and bogus news stories — played a role in the political rise and eventual election of Donald Trump as the 45th U.S. President. It remains to be seen how Milner’s ties to the Kremlin are playing with Washington regulators. One big question is whether the publication of these connections might spur questions from authorities. But Milner — a popular figure in Silicon Valley who settled part-time into a $100 million home in Silicon Valley’s Los Altos Hills in 2011 and who attended Mark Zuckerberg’s backyard wedding in 2012 — seems to continue to enjoy the support of his fellow investors. At the Web Summit conference in Lisbon yesterday, famed investor Jim Breyer, who led Facebook’s Series A round while managing the venture firm Accel Partners, and who remained on the board of Facebook until 2013, said of Milner: “I’m a fan of Yuri. I’ve known him since 2010. I just don’t know more than that. He’s a very good investor.” Asked if the Times story would affect Breyer’s willingness to work with Milner right now, Breyer merely shrugged and said, “I don’t know,” as if to suggest he’s waiting to see what happens next but isn’t concerned by it. In response to the Times piece, DST Global offered a statement to the outlet, echoing similar messaging that DST has issued in the past, which is that it does not take a board seat or voting rights in any of its portfolio companies. Its Times statement further added, “It is worth remembering that Russia-U.S. relations were much better in 2009 and 2011 when these investments were made following Secretary of State Clinton pressing the ‘Reset Button‘ in Moscow in 2009.” DST Global notes that a “majority” of its investments have been non-U.S. companies, and that less than five percent of that funding has come from VTB Bank, which it characterizes as “the only Russian government institution that invested in any DST Global fund.” The letter from DST Global’s management team to its limited partners seems designed to assuage investors that DST will protect their identities despite coming under scrutiny itself. “While certain assertions made by the press are inaccurate or incomplete, DST Global is not at liberty to divulge information regarding its investors and will not do so without their consent,” the firm writes. DST also seems to take pains to distance itself from Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, an Uzbek-Russian oligarch who is reportedly close to the Russian prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev, and has ties to Kanton Services, an outfit that reportedly received hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from Gazprom, a state-controlled natural-gas giant. Kanton, the Times had reported, owned one of the DST investment vehicles used to buy shares of Facebook. Perhaps most pointedly, the letter notes that Usmanov was but one of 50 limited partners in the DST Global entities that invested in Facebook. DST further says it had “no knowledge of any commercial lending relationships of Mr. Usmanov, including with any governmental counterparties, to finance any portion of his DST Global investments.” Not last, DST notes that while Usmanov was an LP in its first two funds, “neither Mr. Usmanov nor any other Russian investor (other than Mr. Milner and some DST Global team members) [is] an LP in any of DST Global III (2012), DST Global IV (2014) or DST Global V (2015).” You can read the rest of its letter to investors here: We reached out to DST Global, Facebook, and Twitter for comment on this story. We have yet to hear back from DST or Facebook. However, Twitter sent us the following statement: “DST Global is a well known entity in Silicon Valley and a big investor in tech (they have invested significantly in Facebook, Groupon, Zynga, Spotify, Airbnb, Alibaba, Slack, Box, etc.). We announced via an August 2011 blog post that DST Global led a round of investments in Twitter. They have since divested their interest from Twitter in May, 2014. “We can confirm that DST Investments 3 was a Twitter investor and was one of the funds of DST Global. We disclosed that DST Investments 3 was an investor / party to our pre-IPO Investor Rights Agreement and Voting Agreement and filed those agreements here and here. As a matter of policy, Twitter conducted reviews of all pre-IPO investors. After our IPO in November 2013, we reviewed all potential investors in accordance with FCC regulations.”  \n",

            "Facebook  is testing a new method to combat revenge porn in Australia, the Australia Broadcasting Corporation reports. The strategy entails uploading your nude photos or videos to Messenger in order to help Facebook tag it as non-consensual explicit media. Facebook is doing this in partnership with Australian government agency e-Safety in order to try to prevent people from sharing intimate images without consent. If someone fears they are at risk of revenge porn, they can contact e-Safety. The organization might then tell them to send a nude photo of themselves to themselves via Messenger. Facebook’s hashing system would then be able to recognize those images in the future without needing to store them on its servers. “They’re not storing the image, they’re storing the link and using artificial intelligence and other photo-matching technologies,” e-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant told ABC. “So if somebody tried to upload that same image, which would have the same digital footprint or hash value, it will be prevented from being uploaded.” Back in April, Facebook addressed revenge porn in the U.S. with a new photo-matching technology to ensure people can’t re-share images previously reported and tagged as revenge porn. Facebook’s new tools around tackling revenge porn came shortly after a scandal involving people on both Facebook and Instagram targeting female Marines in private groups. Australia is one of four countries participating in this test trial of sending nudes to prevent nudes from showing up, Facebook told ABC. It’s not clear where else Facebook is piloting this method to combat revenge porn. I’ve reached out to Facebook and will update this story if I hear back.  \n",

            "51 Facebook introduces a Messenger plugin for business websites\n",
            "Facebook  Messenger is coming to businesses’ own websites. The social network announced today the launch of a new customer chat plugin into closed beta, which will allow customers to talk directly with businesses on their websites using Messenger, and continue those conversations across web, mobile and tablet devices. While there are already plenty of customer support and chat plugins for websites on the market, Facebook’s advantage is its platform and reach. Not only does the ability to use Messenger mean the business is making itself available within an application that now reaches some 1.2 billion monthly users and growing, the Messenger platform also supports features like payments, bots that understand natural language, and rich media, among other things. Facebook says these features will also be supported in the beta version of the website plugin, and new experiences will be added in time, so the plugin is as “feature-rich” as the Messenger app itself.  Like other web chat systems, the Messenger chat plugin is designed to hover over top the business’s web page, and is indicated by the familiar, blue Messenger icon. When a customer starts a chat session with the business, they’ll be presented with the same sort of Messenger interface they’re already used to from using the app on their mobile devices. When customers leave the website, they’ll still be able to view or continue their conversation from their phone or tablet, using their Messenger app. (This may also be useful if the business doesn’t respond instantly to user requests coming in through Messenger from the web.)  For businesses that already have a sizable Facebook presence and regularly engage with customers through their Facebook Page, a chat plugin for their website may make sense as they won’t have to maintain a separate channel for user inquiries from the web. It could also take some of the strain off the company’s support email, which is where many websites today direct customer questions. However, the chat plugin may not be as useful for sites that do troubleshooting and tech support through their chat systems, as it doesn’t connect with other backend support systems – like when a chat session is the starting point for directing customers to the right support agent, for example. It also lacks some of the more robust analytical tools the professional systems offer. And it may not be ideal for businesses that are cataloging online leads via chat. This new addition to the Messenger platform is only one of several ways Facebook has been targeting business customers in recent months. Earlier this year, the company introduced new discovery mechanisms for finding Messenger bots, and it allowed its “M” in-app assistant to suggest businesses’ bots when relevant to conversations. Facebook even tested Messenger ads that would allow businesses to reach the app’s users with offers to chat, shop, sign up for things, and more. The new plugin is now being trialed by a number of partners, including AdoreMe, Air France, Argos, Aviva, Bodeaz, Goibibo, Keto Mojo, KLM, Mermaid Pillow, Spoqa, Total Activation, Volaris and Zalando. During this beta period, other interested businesses can sign up to be notified when the chat plugin is broadly available, says Facebook.  \n",

            "Swag, especially good swag, can be important. That’s where Swag.com comes in. The company, which launched 15 months ago, aims to be a way for companies to get quality swag to help people rep their brands. “People think of swag as junk, but it shouldn’t be,” Swag co-founder Jeremy Parker told TechCrunch. “It could be an amazing marketing tool if it’s built right.” Swag.com  offers products like water bottles, umbrellas, shirts, jackets, USB drives, bags and other items from brands like Patagonia and Case Logic. Once you pick the product, you upload your designs, specify how many you want printed and then wait for Swag to send you the production mock-up for approval. Standard production time takes about 15 days, while priority production takes 10 days and costs a bit more. Production doesn’t start until the customer has approved the mock-up. Because Swag works directly with the manufacturer and vendor, it doesn’t have to hold any inventory. “We’re like Barney’s but without the inventory,” Parker said. Swag currently has about 1,000 customers, including the likes of Facebook, Evernote, WeWork and Waze. With WeWork, Swag is integrated into the co-working space’s app for services, and is currently the No. 1 service for office needs.  “We love Swag.com because we know that every time we make an order it’s going to come out perfect!” WeWork Account Coordinator Casey Cadden said in a statement. “Every product on Swag.com has been vetted and tested and they only offer top quality products. Also, it’s insanely easy to use.” Since starting the company, Swag has done more than $1 million in sales. What differentiates Swag from the likes of CustomInk and other competitors, Parker said, is its attention to detail and ease of use. For example, Parker pointed out that Swag guarantees each brand’s colors will be spot on, Pantone-matched. Though, CustomInk also seems to do the same thing. Swag, which recently completed Techstars Chicago, has raised about $800,000 in seed funding. Parker says the company is in the process of closing a round of $1 million.  \n",

            "Facebook  Questions first launched in 2010 as a Quora wannabe before shifting into lighter-weight polls, but Facebook shut down the feature in 2012. Apparently it was just ahead of its time, as Facebook went poll-crazy this year, adding them to Instagram Stories and Messenger group chat, as well as buying hit teen anonymous polling app tbh. Plus, it’s had bare-bones multiple-choice text polls for Facebook Pages for years. Now the social network is officially launching Facebook Polls, with the added options of using photos or GIFs as answers. Polls are coming to people and Pages on iOS, Android and desktop today.  Facebook’s been testing these new Polls since at least September, but now everyone will have access. You just open the status composer on your profile or Page, select Polls, write your question and two answers, optionally upload images or choose from a library of GIFs, attach links to answers if you want, choose an expiration date for your polls, post and then you and everyone who votes can see the results. Beware, the answers aren’t anonymous and aren’t only visible to a poll’s creator.  Facebook Polls will provide an easy way to spur conversation, gather opinions or organize plans. You could ask which TV show is better using GIFs of the programs, find out which of your outfits friends prefer or figure out which movie your pals want to go see tonight. Polls could make interactive social media simple. Instead of just Liking like a zombie or struggling to come up with a comment, friends and Pages can let you express a specific opinion with just a click.  \n",

            "54 Pimax is raking in millions for an ‘8K’ VR headset to take on Facebook and HTC\n",
            "If you’re paying attention to the virtual reality market, 2017 would appear to be a pretty awful time to start growing a VR hardware startup. OculusVR’s Kickstarter campaign took place more than five years ago and since then there’s been a burst of activity in the VR market that has driven a lot of hype though actual sales might not have reached stratospheric expectations. This is not stopping Pimax VR, a Shanghai based startup founded in 2015, from planning to launch an ambitious headset that will likely retail for double the price of current high-end VR hardware. The company’s Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign closes tomorrow and it has already raised more than $3.8 million. The Pimax 8K headset (which will run on Valve’s SteamVR platform) gets its name from the dual 4K LCD displays that give the device its large hammerhead shark look. For many, what’s more exciting is the headset’s bizarrely wide field-of-view. While current generation headsets are often somewhere between 90 and 110 degrees, Pimax is aiming for 200 degrees. I had a chance to take a look at the latest prototype of the headset and chat with Pimax CEO Nordic Ren about the company’s ambitions and how it possibly plans to succeed in a market that has Facebook, Google and Microsoft staking claims. While everyone else is going for the mass market right now, Ren tells me that he plans to succeed by capturing the attention on the high-end. “HTC and Oculus are good but not good enough,” he says. Gif via Pimax It seems evident that Facebook’s Oculus is only going to be moving more resources towards all-in-one headsets and away from boundary-pushing PC headsets like the Rift. This is going to leave an exploitable subset of early adopters that will want a headset that can integrate with omnidirectional treadmills, haptic gloves, smell sensors and more while running boundary and bank-breaking GPUs. It’s definitely a weird niche of consumers, but considering the startup has already received pledges for nearly more than 5,000 headsets already, it’s clear they definitely exist. What’s also apparent is that this product getting into consumer’s hands is also going to rely on more venture funding stacked on top of the several million dollars they’ll draw in from the Kickstarter. I asked Ren what the company’s biggest obstacle would be in shipping the headsets and he said getting “more money,” noting that the startup was currently putting together more funding from outside investors. Though the Kickstarter pricing for the full 8K setup is $800 (the headset alone is $499), Ren said final retail pricing has not been decided, though I truly cannot imagine that this headset (along with controllers and sensors) will retail for less than $1,000 as a package. There is frankly no way that the startup is going to deliver a product anywhere near its Kickstarter’s estimated delivery date of January 2018 given that the final design of central things like the lenses is still very much in progress. While Ren said the company would “do their best” to hit a launch somewhere in that window, he sounded a bit overwhelmed by the number of pre-orders the company had already received. For comparison, Fove, a VR headset company that also launched their headset via Kickstarter closed its campaign in May of 2015 selling more than 1,000 headsets with a targeted ship date of one year later. They missed that date by 8 months and had to raise $11M in funding in the meantime.  I had the chance to be one of the first people to check out the third major prototype of the headset, which expands the device’s signature wide field-of-view through a new 3-part frankensteined lens array that practically hugs onto your eyeballs. The lenses brought the virtual image to the outer reaches of my own vision in a way that was almost overwhelming but showcases an evolution for VR hardware that definitely lived up to Pimax’s promises. Notably, there were some major distortions if you tried to glance all the way left or right largely because games do not natively run at a resolution this wide and there’s some software stretching Pimax has had to do to display content at 200 degrees that was rendered at 180. The high-resolution 4K displays offered a noticeable upgrade in sharpness and clarity though in terms of gameplay the field-of-view seemed to matter much more. There were still visible pixels as these are 4K screens but they are 4K screens an inch or two from your eyes. Nevertheless, the optics quality was very good on the prototype. I demoed some familiar titles on the headset including Elite Dangerous and The Blu. The PC that was powering the experience was stocked with a 1080 graphics card, which — just for that one component — costs more than some of the full Oculus-ready PCs on the market currently. Pimax is aiming to make the final headset capable of running most titles while utilizing a mildly cheaper 1070 GPU, which Ren noted may still be a “little bit tough” to do. For backers, the risks of funding a Kickstarter campaign for a hardware startup are lessened somewhat by the fact that the company has put VR headsets through production and the leadership is well-connected to manufacturing pipelines in Shenzhen, but the uncertainty is still there as to what exactly the finished project will ship with. The prototype I demoed was running at 75hz rather than the 90 it hopes to ship with, Ren was discussing a redesign of the lenses on the way, and there are still many questions on whether the headset will be able to run on anything but the highest end GPUs. This will more than likely not ship on time, and the company is still making promises as to what extra things backers will be getting. Extra assurances made on the admission that the company may still need outside funding it has not yet secured in order to ship the device. The Pimax 8K is a very exciting piece of hardware with some eye-catching features, but as the Kickstarter campaign draws to a close and the company looks to ship thousands of headsets, it’s apparent that while the displays are sharp, the next few months leading up to the targeted ship dates are much, much blurrier.  \n",

            "55 Here’s how Russia targeted its fake Facebook ads and how those ads performed\n",
            "It’s impossible to know just how much stuff being circulated on social networks is Russian state content in sheep’s clothing, although tech companies are scrambling to figure that out. Now, thanks to Congress, we just got a rare peek behind the curtain of how Facebook’s ad operations were manipulated by a foreign power to foment outrage and division in American society. Today the House Intelligence Committee published a selection of Facebook and Instagram political ads that were bought by entities linked to the Russian government. All of these ads appealed to divisions in American society, often falling along political and identity-based fault lines. The committee signaled last month that it would be releasing all 3,000 of the ads that Facebook  had provided, but instead it opted to share a sample of around 25 U.S. political and issue-based ad buys with Russian government links. (We’ve collected those here in one place so you don’t have to deal with the PDFs.) As the chart below illustrates, no one was exempt. The Russian ads targeted the far left and the far right, seeking to manipulate black activists, Muslims, Christians, LGBTQ people, gun owners and even fans of Ivanka Trump’s jewelry line. Sometimes the ads were targeted by location, organizing real-life events in states like New York and Florida. As you’d expect, the ad spend positively correlates to how many impressions and clicks a given ad generated, though only a few of these ad campaigns — which are not by any means all of the ads — cost much over $1,000. We’ve known some of this, but today we got to see not just a representative sample of the ads themselves, but how much they cost, who exactly they targeted and how well they performed. It’s interesting stuff, so we collected it into a sortable chart with links to images of the ads so you can see for yourself.   \n",

            "56 Facebook beats in Q3 with $4.7B profit, record share price despite Russia\n",
            "Facebook  is still in the middle of its House Intelligence Committee hearing about Russian election interference, but the looming concerns over misuse haven’t dampened its business as profits continue to soar and its share price hits an all-time high. Still, CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw it fit to break from his traditional “Our business is doing well” script to add “But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don’t bring people closer together. We’re serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We’re investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.” But those changes haven’t hit Facebook’s profitability yet, as it climbed 79% year-over-year to $4.7 billion. Facebook’s announced Q3 2017 earnings today, continuing its streak of beating estimates. Facebook earned $10.3 billion in revenue and $1.59 GAAP actual earnings per share, compared to estimates of $9.84 billion in revenue and $1.28 EPS. Facebook’s EPS is up 76% year-over-year, showing how efficient of a money-maker it’s become.  Revenue growth was 47% year-over-year compared to 59% in Q3 2016, which matches Facebook’s warnings that it’s running out of space to show ads. Mobile as a percentage of Facebook’s ad revenue inched up from 87% to 88% this quarter as it reaches a stabilization point in its successful shift to mobile. Average revenue per daily active  user reached $7.51 vs $5.95 a year ago. That 26% increase shows how even as Facebook’s daily user growth has grown a more modest 16% over the year, Facebook has found better and better ways to squeeze money out of people. As for users counts, Facebook now has 2.06 billion monthly active users, up 3.19% compared to last quarter’s 2.006 billion and 3.4% growth rate. Daily active users reached 1.37 billion, up 3.8% quarter-over-quarter. Facebook’s stickiness, or the percentage of monthly actives users that return each day has stayed flat at 66% since Q1 2016. But that’s actually a great success, since most apps grow less sticky over time as users churn and the less engaged long-tail signs up.  Facebook’s share price had closed at $182.66 prior to the earnings announcement, and climbed 1.28% in after-hours trading. Facebook has a full war chest in case it wants to make any big acquisitions, with $38.29 billion in cash marketable securities at the end of Q3 2017. During the earnings call, Zuckerberg voiced his support for potential government regulation of ads transparency, saying he thinks it would be “very good if it’s done well”, even as Facebook attempts to self-regulate. CFO David Wehner says Facebook will boost its expenses 45% to 60% in 2018 in order to fund security efforts following the Russian intrusion, as well as original video, AI, VR, and AR. Facebook will hire 10,000 people to monitor content and ads, though some will be contractors, and it plans to double its security engineering work force. Zuckerberg says that Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status both now have 300 million daily active users, up from 250 million in June and July respectively. That means these Snapchat clones are nearly 2X as big as the entire Snapchat app, which has 173 million daily actives. While the business is shinging, in the press it’s been a grim few months for Facebook as it’s scrambled to improve its abuse detection systems following Russian election interference. Meanwhile, it’s scared news publishers with tests of a News Feed that removes all Pages and places them in a separate, buried feed. But prioritizing the user experience has allowed Facebook to continue to thrive amidst its many challenges and widespread public backlash.  \n",

            "57 On Russia, tech doesn’t know what it doesn’t know\n",
            "While the Senate has spent the better part of a year making sense of Russia’s actions to influence the 2016 election, tech made quick work of its own analysis — or so it thinks. The glacial pace of Congress is often criticized, particularly contrasted to the tech industry, which still moves fast and breaks things, although Facebook gave up that slogan in 2014. But when it comes to examining a high-stakes blind spot undermining governments and endangering users on the biggest social networks in existence, somehow Congress looks more prepared. After Facebook’s September investigation revealed accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a detail that the company disclosed to Congress on September 6, all three companies have seized on that as both a starting and finishing place for their own investigations. Yesterday, in the first of three hearings with Facebook, Twitter and Google, Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch admitted that his company doesn’t know if North Korea or Iran bought political ads on Facebook, while admitting that other U.S. adversaries “certainly potentially” could. On Wednesday, Senate Intel Vice Chair Mark Warner voiced his ongoing disappointment with tech’s narrow investigation parameters and their failure to proactively ferret out Russian active measures on their platforms. “I still find it very disturbing that it appears, at least from Twitter and Facebook, that the sense is that all the Russian active measures only originated with one single troll farm in St. Petersburg,” Warner said. “It still appears that most of the work that you’ve provided us is still derivative of your initial reports. “I was hoping very much that you would come in today and either say ‘that was absolutely all of it’ or ‘we’ve identified other troll farms or other entities.’ ” When Warner pressed each company to answer in yes or no form if they’d discovered the full extent of Russian active measures, all three eventually admitted that they haven’t. Facebook claimed it hasn’t “with certainty.” Twitter admitted that it’s “still working on it.” Google called it “an ongoing investigation.” Warner scolded Facebook leadership for “bragging” about how proactive they were in the French election without doing the due diligence on those accounts with regard to U.S. political activity. “You’ve identified 470 accounts from one troll farm in St. Petersburg. There have been plenty of press reports of other troll farms in Russia,” Warner said. “As you became more aware of this problem, you aggressively promoted the fact that you took down 30,000 accounts around the French elections… have you gone back and cross-checked those Russian-related accounts that you took down in France to see if any of those accounts were active in the American election?” Stretch couldn’t answer, stating that he would get back to the panel, a response that Warner deemed “very disappointing” given that the company has known about the hearing for months and that he has brought the issue up before. TechCrunch has also followed up with Facebook to see if they took this step. Update: When asked for comment on Warner’s question about the French election, Facebook pointed TechCrunch to a tweet from Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos: Want to clear up something that came up in the Senate Intel hearing this morning: pic.twitter.com/U1Dvf8VhdP — Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) November 1, 2017  When asked by Idaho Senator Risch if Facebook, Twitter and Google agreed with his assessment that the issue at hand is “much broader” than just the 2016 election, all three companies did so reluctantly, with Google adding that it’s “hard for us to know.” It’s no surprise, then, that incremental updates to initial analyses that underreported the scope of Russia’s efforts on the three platforms comes out every week now. Just this morning, Facebook admitted that Instagram content purchased by Russian state-linked actors reached an additional 16 million Americans between October 2016 and November 8. We can expect an ongoing controlled stream of similar updates as the three tech companies in congressional crosshairs try to balance the appearance of cooperation with lawmakers with their refusal to fully admit the scope of systemic problems on their platforms. The inherent contradiction is akin to so many others we see in Silicon Valley — like the illusion of transparency in an industry culture of extreme secrecy or Facebook’s conviction of its own political potency in ad sales at the same time — that its chief executive waved off the notion that his company “influenced the election in any way” as a “crazy idea.” Suggesting that the scope of foreign intelligence operations on U.S.-based social platforms goes well beyond what we know now isn’t meant to be scaremongering. More, it’s an argument that these companies — most notably Facebook with its historic, ironic insistence on “real identity” —  were blinded by growth in a way that made them fail to consider the future consequences of building the most colossal, most efficient global information delivery system of the present day. “What we’re talking about is a cataclysmic change… we are not gonna go away, gentlemen,” California Senator Feinstein said on Wednesday, beating the drums of regulation. “This is a very big deal. I went home last night with profound disappointment. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers. “You bear this responsibility. You’ve created these platforms and now they’re being misused. And you have to be the ones to do something about it. Or we will.”   \n",

            "58 Trump and Clinton spent $81M on US election Facebook ads, Russian agency $46K\n",
            "Russian information troll farm the Internet Research Agency spent just 0.05 percent as much on Facebook  ads as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump’s campaigns combined in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, yet still reached a massive audience. While there might have been other Russian disinformation groups, the IRA spent $46,000 on pre-election day Facebook ads compared to $81 million spent by Clinton and Trump together, discluding political action committees who could have spent even more than that on the campaigns’ behalf. Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch revealed these figures today during the Senate Intelligence Committee’s hearing with Facebook, Twitter and Google about Russian election interference. Without counting PACs, the top campaigns spent 1,760X more on election ads than one group of Russian meddlers puts the situation into context. The IRA ad buy was small by comparison. This aligns with Stretch’s main talking point that Russian propaganda content was a tiny fraction of the content and ads seen on Facebook. This revelation could put more focus on organically posted propaganda. [Update: However, since the IRA was using incendiary, divisive, eye-drawing content about polarizing issues, it likely was able to squeeze more impressions and engagment out of each dollar of spend than Trump and Clinton’s ads driving awareness for the candidates That’s because Facebook’s ad auction system preferences engaging ads by providing lower rates. By focusing on hot-button issues and playing into people’s biases, the IRA’s ads got widely re-shared for free by viewers.] Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch, Twitter general counsel Sean Edgett and Google general counsel Kent Walker testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee Facebook today said that the Russians still reached 126 million Facebook users, as well as 20 million Instagram users. But Facebook, Twitter and Google all confirmed that their investigations have found no evidence that the Russians uploaded voter registration contact info in order to individually target voters with ads. Facebook had previously announced that $100,000 was spent on Facebook ads from June 2015 to May 2017 by Russian-linked disinformation sources, while an additional $50,000 was spent by Russians that signals indicate weren’t or were only weakly connected to an organized disinformation campaign. Stretch says that the IRA was attacking the election as early as 2015. But one major issue is that there could still be other unidentified Russian groups that also tried to interfere with the 2016 election. Stretch, Twitter general counsel Sean Edgett and Google’s general counsel Kent Walker all agreed that their investigations are ongoing, so they can’t be sure they’ve identified all active measures of disinformation implemented by the Russians. That’s in part why Congress asked the companies to retain all data relevant to their investigation beyond the 11 month requirement of media organizations that run election ads. Facebook, Twitter and Google looked ill-prepared when asked if they’d calculated how much revenue they’d earned off of legitimate ads that ran beside Russian organic propaganda content. None could say how much they profited off distributing non-ad Russian election interference. Throughout the hearing, there was little substantive talk of regulation for social media election ads beyond mentions of the Honest Ads Act that’s in the works. Most of the senators instead spent their time handing out reprimands for past failures, and bleating about how important the issue was rather than putting forward new solutions. Senator Richard Burr closed the session asking the companies to prevent disruption of America’s future, abide by Federal Election Commission law, and that they should request anti-trust waivers if they need to further cooperate with each other. It will indeed require a joint effort and strategy sharing to defeat election interference, especially if Facebook, Google and Twitter want to avoid heavy-handed regulation.   \n",

            "59 In their first Russia hearing, tech giants try to placate Congress (with mixed results)\n",
            "On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee kicked off the first of three hearings this week examining the relationship between social media and Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The hearings mark the first time that lawmakers will hear testimony from Google, Facebook and Twitter around how their platforms were and are manipulated as part of Russian political disinformation campaigns targeting U.S. voters. “This is really a critical hearing,” Committee Chair Lindsey Graham declared in his opening remarks. “It marks the first time we will have heard from the three agencies about exactly what is going on and what exactly they are prepared to do to stop it.” Graham struck a friendly note early on, informing the panel that “the purpose of this hearing is to figure out how we can help you.” Predictably, the tech representatives weren’t fooled by a group of lawmakers that appears increasingly eager to regulate their ad operations. As Tuesday’s hearing was the first of three, the big question is just how cooperative the three companies would be. All three elected to send their general counsel rather than top executives to the hearing, a move that signaled they’d prefer to remain tight lipped and well within the comfort zones they’re used to in friendlier territory. They mostly succeeded, even when things got a bit awkward for a trio of companies far too accustomed to exercising near total control of the narrative around their products. None of these tech giants are used to having their feet held to the fire, and some members of the committee, particularly Louisiana Senator John Kennedy and Minnesota Senator Al Franken, proved eager to do so. When Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, who bore the brunt of the committee’s ire, responded tepidly to his line of questioning about the company’s responsibility, Franken rebuked the panel explosively. “You put billions of data points together all the time… you can’t put together rubles and a political ad? How did you not connect those two dots?” Kennedy picked up a line of questioning threaded early on by Graham, turning to exactly the kind of rapid fire questions that the tech companies dispatched their legal reps to dodge. Kennedy: “Did China run ads in the last election cycle to try to impact our election? Did Turkmenistan?” Stretch: “Not that I’m aware of” Kennedy: “How can you be aware? You’ve got five million advertisers and you’re gonna tell me that you can trace the origin of all of those advertisers?” Stretch: “No sir, I cannot” Kennedy: “That’s your testimony under oath?” On the issue of banning foreign currency in political ads — and many other issues, including how they’ll deal with shell companies — the trio was non-committal. They refused to endorse Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s bipartisan Honest Ads Act when pressed, gesturing that they would be willing to cooperate on legislation but they’d really prefer to self-govern (since that’s gone so well). Klobuchar took that opportunity to skewer the regulation-phobic companies. “There wouldn’t be an outside enforcer of any of your policies, is that right?,” she demanded. They reluctantly admitted she was right and surely took notes for how to handle tomorrow’s likely continuation of questioning around that legislation. That sheepish admission and others were about the only candid moments that the hearing produced, as it swung from Russian intelligence operations to Islamic extremists and even to a predictably useless interlude from Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who squandered his time with a distracting line of questioning that accused the companies of partisanship. The exchanges set a tone for tomorrow’s intelligence committee hearings, which are likely to be meatier and more aggressive, particularly in the Senate. In round one, Google,  Facebook and Twitter cooperated, but they weren’t particularly helpful, opting to mostly cover their asses with pre-planned statements and platform reports designed to appease lawmakers and stave off regulation. All three were eager to tout their own home remedies for political disinformation campaigns — hire actual humans, build AI, et cetera — but remained unwilling to conduct the kind of deep self examination necessary to inoculate themselves outright.   \n",

            "60 Russian-backed content may have reached 126 million on Facebook\n",
            "Facebook  has reportedly upped its estimate of how much content was produced by Russian-backed actors during the election and how widely that content was seen. According to prepared remarks due to be presented tomorrow but acquired by The Wall Street Journal today, the company estimates 80,000 pieces of content may have been viewed by a total of 126 million people. The news came as part of what appears to be a concerted effort to spread the news online ahead of the hearing at the Senate’s judiciary subcommittee on crime and terrorism. Remarks were obtained by several outlets and Google even put up an official blog post to accompany the news stories. Previous estimates by Facebook included only the 3,000 ads from 470 separate accounts associated with Russian “entity” the Internet Research Agency. But organic posts, images, events and other things also matter, not just ads — so Facebook was asked to include these, as well. The resulting numbers aren’t pretty, though it must be said that with engagement on Facebook, the numbers are astronomical to begin with, so even tiny fractions of overall activity end up with 9 or 10 figures. That’s not to say that reaching 126 million people is a trivial task; you could spend a lot of money and not get close to that. That’s where networks of bots and fake accounts come in. By juicing the ads, posts and so on with likes, shares and tags, bot networks would have been crucial in getting these pieces of content onto more news feeds. In fact, the leaked remarks put the original reach at 29 million users, meaning sharing mechanisms more than quadrupled the number who potentially saw the content. Twitter and Google will be represented at the hearing, as well. Twitter is expected to announce that the number of Russia-linked accounts associated with election interference is not 200 but 2,700, according to documents acquired by Recode, and that together they tweeted some 1.4 million times about the election. Google is also bringing new numbers to the meeting, which were acquired by The New York Times — but the engagement levels are orders of magnitude smaller. Facebook has already admitted failure to some degree in allowing these ads to have been shown, and has pledged a variety of countermeasures. I’ve asked the company for comment and more details on the numbers above, and will update this post accordingly if I hear back.  \n",

            "61 Senator Feinstein makes broad request for all ‘Russia-connected’ Twitter and Facebook user data\n",
            "The nature and extent of Russia or Russian-linked actors interfering with the Presidential election is yet to be determined, but it’s not for want of inquiries. Half the people on Capitol Hill are looking into it in one way or another, and Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) is no exception; her position as head Democrat on the Judiciary Committee rather demands it. Today the Senator sent letters to several parties involved, including Facebook and Twitter, asking for a wide variety of documents relating to her investigations. Five letters were sent, requesting too many items to list here exhaustively. The two sent to Facebook and Twitter were similar down the phrasing in many questions. She thanks both companies for their cooperation with other investigations, then asks for documents relating to the ads found to be part of a coordinated effort to sway users in favor of voting Trump. Ads targeting similar subsets of people and metadata about the ads (clicks, shares, etc) are also requested. She also wants to see “Documents sufficient to show whether and how [Facebook/Twitter] is undertaking efforts to identify other accounts that had a connection to Russia’s influence campaign in the 2016 election.” In other words, what are you doing about it? There’s also an extremely broad request that I can’t see either company fulfilling: “All ads and organic content posted by Russia-connected users and targeted to any part of the United States, regardless of whether the individual or entity violated any [Facebook/Twitter] policy.” And by Russia-connected she means in pretty much any way: language setting, currency or services used, IP address, or other targeting data. This seems like one the companies will push back on (and with good reason). I contacted both companies to see what they thought of the request. Twitter declined to comment, and I’m waiting to hear back from Facebook. There are unique requests for both, however, and for specific interference methods supposed to have taken place on the respective platforms. Google, despite also being under suspicion of having interference activities take place on its platforms, was not contacted. One letter was sent to Michael Cohen, a Trump-related lawyer who is suggested to have orchestrated the release of DNC data through contacts in the Kremlin; he is requested to appear in person before November 6 and bring a truckload of data with him. Another went to Cambridge Analytica, the data analysis firm that the Trump campaign reportedly went to for help organizing the data produced by the DNC hack. The last letter went to the White House, asking for less tech-oriented info — Comey and Kushner stuff. November 6 is the shared due date for all this information, though the data requested is extensive enough that we are likely to see pleas for time.  \n",

            "In response to concerns that Russia used Facebook  ads in an attempt to influence last year’s presidential election, the social network has said it will increase transparency by allowing anyone to see any ad run by any organization. Now it’s releasing a few more details about its plans, like the fact that the new transparency features are expected to go live next month. Once they do, when you’re looking at a Facebook Page, you should be able to click “View Ads” and bring up all the ads that Page is currently running. (You can see an example of a View Ads page at the end of this post.) Facebook says it’s starting out with a test in Canada. When the feature expands to the United States, it’s also supposed to include an archive of ads related to federal elections, covering “a rolling four-year period” that starts at the launch of the archive. And it will include additional information like the total and average amounts spent on ads, the number of impressions an ad received and the demographics that were targeted. The company also says political advertisers will have to verify their identity, their location and the fact that their ad is election-related. The ads will come with a “paid for by” message that you can click on for more information. And Facebook says it’s building machine learning tools so that it can find the political advertisers who don’t identify themselves. Will most Facebook users take advantage of these capabilities? Maybe not, but vice president of Ads Rob Goldman writes, “Transparency helps everyone, especially political watchdog groups and reporters, keep advertisers accountable for who they say they are and what they say to different groups.” This news comes as Congress considers a bipartisan bill proposing new regulations for online ads, and shortly after Twitter announced some similar transparency measures.   \n",

            "63 Facebook rolls out new tools for group admins, plus badges and profiles for members\n",
            "Facebook  today introduced a good handful of new features for groups on Facebook, with a focus on helping admins better manage and grow their online communities, and helping members better connect with one another. The additions, inspired by user feedback, include support for welcome posts, badges, member profiles and other admin-level controls. The company met this June with hundreds of Facebook group admins at its first-ever Facebook Communities Summit in Chicago. This allowed Facebook staff to hear directly from those who run online groups what sort of tools they need. One common activity that admins do is welcome new members to their Facebook group. But until today, this has been done manually by writing a post, then locating each new member and tagging them one-by-one in that post. A new “welcome posts” feature, however, lets admins write a welcome post that automatically tags new members, speeding up the process.  Two other new features are focused on helping members better get to know one another, as well as their admin team and other group leaders. With the new badges, members will now be able to easily spot group admins, moderators and members who only recently joined the group. Meanwhile, member can also now view group-specific profiles about others when they click on their name. This gives you a brief intro to the person using publicly available information, like how long they’ve been a member of the group, whether you have mutual friends or if they’re attending any of the same events as you. The idea, Facebook explains, is to help people discover if they have anything in common with the other group member. These mini-profiles also have buttons that let you view the person’s full Facebook profile, message them directly or add them as a friend.  Facebook is also introducing new tools and controls for groups, including a Group Insights tool that offers tips like when to schedule posts based on historical member engagement data. And admins can now turn off commenting on a per-member basis instead of locking down an entire post’s comments, to help keep conversations flowing without the bad elements. They can additionally choose to boot members from multiple groups they manage with a single click, if those members can’t abide by the group rules.  These are the first of many changes to come to Facebook Groups in the days ahead, Facebook notes, as it learned a lot from its interactions with community admins, it says. It also started an invite-only Facebook group for admins where it can collect further feedback. The new tools and features are rolling out starting today.  \n",

            "Buy a car through Facebook,  and the social network could earn a special place in your heart. So Facebook is creating a dedicated section of Marketplace for vehicles. You’ll now be able to use new search filters to find a ride with a specific type, make, model, mileage, transmission, and more from both people and car dealerships like Edmunds, Cars.com, Auction123, CDK Global, and SocialDealer. You can check pricing against the industry standard Kelly’s Blue Book. And you can use Messenger bots to communicate with dealers in real-time instead of filling out a contact form and waiting to hear back.  Search volume in Facebook’s peer-to-peer classifieds directory that launched a year ago has grown 3X globally since the start of 2017, with 18 million listings being added in the US alone in May. There’s also been 77% growth in unique conversations between buyers and sellers over the first half of this year. “Autos are one of the most popular categories of Marketplace” says Facebook product manager Bowen Pan. “Millions of people in the US alone are looking at used cars, motorbikes, and other vehicle listings every day” he tells me. So just as Marketplace grew out of the rampant emergent behavior of people creating buy-and-sell Facebook Groups, the Marketplace team followed usage trends to build the new vehicle features. Facebook doesn’t take a cut of any Marketplace transactions. But a few months back it started testing ads within Marketplace to promote certain products. You can imagine that dealerships would happily pay for ads if they could land them a car buyer. Marketplace’s spotlight on cars is just part of Facebook’s ambitious plans for the commerce platform. It’s also working on helping people land jobs, buy tickets through Ticketmaster and Eventbrite, discover daily deals through eBay, browse retail products from the Shop sections of Pages, and next, Facebook plans to tackle real estate so you can find a house or apartment. While Craigslist and various vertical specific sites have been around forever, Facebook is butting in by combining the fact that people don’t need to set up a new account, already visit the app daily, and have visibility into people’s profiles and social graphs can boost trust.       \n",

            "65 Facebook’s Workplace, now at 30,000 orgs, adds Chat desktop apps and group video chat\n",
            "It’s been once year since Workplace, Facebook’s social network designed specifically for businesses and other organizations, came out of beta to take on the likes of Slack, Atlassian, Microsoft and others in the world of enterprise collaboration. Now, with 30,000 organizations using Workplace across some 1 million groups (more than double the figures Facebook published April), Facebook is stepping on the gas again. Today, the company is releasing a desktop app for Workplace Chat, with new features like screen sharing and, in coming months, group video chat, which will let people create virtual “rooms” of up to 50 people for interactive video conferences. Previously, the video features in Workplace were limited to live video broadcasts and one-to-one video conversations. Alongside the new apps and features, Facebook  is also updating the overall design of Workplace to simplify the interface and make it consistent across Android, iOS, desktop and web: Workplace has positioned itself as the collaboration platform for everyone in your organization — not just those who are so-called “knowledge workers” who are at desks most of the day. The idea is that everyone, from executive to barista to warehouse assistant, will find Workplace easy to use because, well, it looks and feels a lot like the hugely popular Facebook. However, the new desktop apps — for both PC and Mac — are a hat tip that there are, in fact, a lot of those desk-sitters using Workplace, too. The two apps have been in beta for a little while, as spotted by my colleague Josh earlier this month. What was not known was Facebook’s plans to put Google Hangouts — as well as Meet, the enterprise version of Hangouts that Google launched in February — in its crosshairs by adding in group video conversations. When Josh spotted the beta of the Chat desktop app with screen sharing, Facebook said the app was made in response to what users were most requesting. But just as important, another key reason is engagement. By adding in more features like screen sharing, desktop apps and group video chat into a Workplace experience, people are more likely to stay in Facebook’s app rather than going elsewhere for those features. (And there are many places to go — not least of which is Slack, which just yesterday updated its own screen sharing feature with the ability to edit on other people’s screens — which had been a big feature of Screenhero, the startup it acquired to build it. Other competitors on the video chat front, ironically, include Facebook Messenger, which added in group video conversations with up to 50 guests last December.) Engagement on Workplace is key, since Facebook charges for Workplace not by seat — a typical pricing metric for enterprise services — but by monthly active user (based on number of users, and the features you want, the charged tiers range between $1 and $3 per MAU). This not only aligns Workplace with its consumer service, but it also, in the words of Julien Codorniou, VP of Workplace, puts his company’s feet to the fire to make sure people actually use it. “If you don’t use it, you don’t pay,” he said in an interview. “That shows the confidence we have and puts pressure on us to build a good product.” And before you wonder, there are still no plans to figure out how to, or even if, to offer a version of Workplace with advertising, which remains Facebook’s mainstay when it comes to revenues and the bottom line. Workplace hit a major scaling milestone last month when it signed up Walmart, the world’s biggest employer with 2.2 million employees, as a customer. But while Facebook has made a lot of progress in terms of signing up new users, it’s been somewhat slower in terms of how it has built out the product overall. One of the key defining characteristics of Slack, as a point of comparison, has been how the chat app (which has over 50,000 paying customers on its books) has positioned itself as a collaboration platform, by making it very easy to integrate many other apps, and bring in data from them, into your Slack conversations. Slack now has thousands of apps in its App Directory that can now be integrated into your own Slack experience. Facebook, on the other hand, has not been as aggressive in building out that aspect of the Workplace platform, with the primary integrations being with some of the more popular services on the market today like Box, Microsoft, Dropbox and Quip/Salesforce. But my guess is that this is not near the end of where Facebook plans to go. Its sights are set not just on helping people communicate what they are working on to each other, but to actually help them get that work done. “We want to build Workplace like we built Facebook,” Codorniou said. “We [first] put everyone on the same network and connect them… when that happens, it goes from communication to automation.” Some of this, it seems, may already be happening on Workplace in smaller cases. Food delivery company Deliveroo has been using the platform to help check in visitors using Envoy, and when someone signs in, the person they are coming in to see gets an automatic ping. Longer term, that could also see Facebook not just taking on significantly more integrations — and working with those who can enable them (as of April of this year, there are now more than 50 partners helping on that front); but also, tapping more into its efforts one with bots and AI to take on some an employee’s workload.  \n",

            "Patreon  wants to colonize the internet with its perks for artist crowdfunding subscribers the same way Facebook login brought your social graph and profile to other sites. Pay a monthly subscription to a content creator on Patreon and now it will earn you exclusive access to their patron-only WordPress blog, Discourse forums, Discord chatrooms and, soon, other apps like Slack. Essentially, Patreon is becoming your content membership card for the whole web, not just its site. And with each new reward opened up by this platform, subscriptions become more valuable and more people will start to fund directly the artists they love. More than 1 million subscribers already pay an average of $12 per month to more than 50,000 creators on Patreon, ranging from illustrators to political commentators to videographers to comedians. It’s on track to double both sides of its membership marketplace each year. And with $107 million in funding, including last month’s $60 million Series C led by Thrive, it has the fuel to build out this new platform that the company expects to support more than 100 integrations, including Slack, within a year. Get access to exclusive or ad-free content on WordPress when you log in with your Patreon subscription It’s all possible thanks to Patreon’s new API, which anyone can build into their product through the Patreon Developer Portal to become a place where patrons can bring their membership. Then, these third-party products will appear in the new App Directory that creators can choose from to extend the benefits of backing them beyond Patreon. That App Directory now includes Zapier, which allows creators to integrate other business apps to assist in managing their patrons, like MailChimp email marketing, Google Sheets, Twitter, Crowdcast live video and 750 more. Patreon’s VP of biz dev and partnerships Brent Horowitz sees this as “Hundreds of spokes organized around this hub called membership, not beholden to or stuck with any one single platform.” That means deficiencies in Patreon’s native tools, like its bare-bones blogging interface, won’t limit the creative expressions of those who monetize with it as they can use WordPress instead. Get special badges that make you stand out in Discourse’s forums when you log in with Patreon And the partnered sites and apps should benefit, too. Linking up with the Patreon platform could bring business tools and content hubs a new influx of clients and creators. Instead of having to build a member-only tier from scratch, sites like WordPress or Discourse can piggyback on Patreon. As Patreon spreads through the web, it’s also looking to become a little less edgy. It willfully accepts some not-safe-for-work content, including nudity, adult fiction and erotic illustration. But it’s now clamping down on not-safe-for-anywhere content depicting fictional “incest, sexual depiction of minors, and suggestive sexual violence.” I’ve heard that some of this that can’t easily be monetized elsewhere was becoming a non-trivial portion of Patreon’s revenue, and it needed to axe it before being seen as complicit with disturbing content. Meanwhile, Patreon has reiterated its support for other niche and human rights content from the LGBTQ community.  YouTube and Twitch, two of the most popular other artist-to-fan communication tools amongst Patreon creators, are still missing from the platform. They both offer their own modest on-site perks for fans who pledge funds to creators. But Horowitz says they only support a binary yes-a-subscriber or not-a-subscriber system, and perks don’t travel anywhere else. Patreon’s platform lets artists set different levels of access for different payment tiers. That way a creator could make their WordPress ad-free for subscribers of $1 a month and up, early access to new content for $5 and up and exclusive patron-only content for $10 and up. Partners won’t earn any of the tiny 5 percent cut Patreon takes from subscriptions, but they could gain access to the most beloved makers on the web and the fan bases that follow them anywhere.  \n",

            "Facebook  should have plenty to talk about, between augmented reality, new acquisitions, the Watch video tab and all its ongoing scandals with Russian election interference, fake news and News Feed reach. Today the company announced its annual F8 developer conference will return to San Jose’s McEnery Convention Center on May 1st and 2nd, 2018. People can sign up for updates on the F8 website, where registration should open around February if last year was any indication. Last year people applied for access during the two-week registration, and then if they were accepted on the basis of merit, could buy tickets for $595.  The event typically kicks off with a keynote by CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlining Facebook’s philosophy, long-term road map and new product launches. Then a parade of product managers come out to demo all the new toys and tools, followed by a day of talks and panels teaching developers and brands how to take advantage of them. Facebook writes that “In addition to more than 50 sessions, attendees can experience interactive demos, have the opportunity to meet Facebook product experts and have the chance to interact with our global developer community.” Last year Facebook debuted its AR Camera Effects Platform, projects from its Building 8 hardware lab (like an effort to let you type with your mind), new artificial intelligence technology and offline mode for Instagram. This year, people will be hotly anticipating more actual functionality from the camera platform, as well as new gadgets from Building 8, like the smart speaker and video screen it’s reportedly working on.  After years in San Francisco, Facebook moved F8 to San Jose last year. TechCrunch will be there in 2018 to deliver you all the news and analysis about the social giant.  \n",

            "If you’re sick of your beautiful videos looking crummy on Facebook, there’s good news for you. After some super HD videos started popping up on the social network, Facebook now confirms to TechCrunch it’s testing 4K video uploads and viewing using the 2160p UHD-1 Ultra-High-Definition Television standard. Some Pages and profiles can now post 4K videos to Facebook, as well as watch them. It’s been a long time coming, considering YouTube first started experimenting with 4K video playback in 2010.  The upgrade could boost Facebook’s Watch tab of original videos. Sports, science, travel and fashion videos could especially benefit from the extra pixels. Here you can check out some examples of 4K game streaming and music videos. Facebook has been getting very serious about video lately, and just today launched the ability to bring a guest into your Instagram Live Story. As Facebook moves from short-form, serendipitously discovered clips into longer-form, deliberately viewed videos more common to YouTube and Netflix, it will need the extra clarity to compete. YouTube started wider rollouts of 4K video in 2014 and 2015, and added 4K live streams in 2016. Facebook launched 4K support for Live 360 videos in July, but its standard 2D videos have long been capped at 720p. That was fine for most of the stuff users shot on their phones. But with Facebook video now attracting high-frames-per-second video game streamers and professional Hollywood content creators, it needed to get with the program. You can make sure you’re watching on the maximum resolution by hitting the gear icon on a Facebook video and switching to 2160p, aka 4K, if it’s available.  \n",

            "69 Facebook releases new guidelines to address publisher concerns in its fight against fake news\n",
            "Facebook  has released new guidelines that outline how publishers can adapt to the company’s efforts to fight back against fake/false news and other low-quality content. Head of News Feed Adam Mosseri  unveiled the guidelines at an event this morning at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, where he said they don’t represent any changes to Facebook’s approach — they’re just a way for publishers to understand the strategy. He added that Facebook’s efforts in this area are “targeted at bad actors.” But for legitimate publishers, the guidelines can still be important to “make sure you don’t get caught up in the crosshairs.” They fall into the three broad areas. First, there’s the importance of meaningful, informative content. For publishers, that means both understanding what their audience wants and also creating fast-loading mobile web experiences. Second, there’s accurate, authentic content. That means publishers should avoid clickbait (such as withholding information in a headline or exaggerating the content), as well as content that’s misleading or that the publisher doesn’t have rights to. Third, Facebook is emphasizing “safe, respectful behavior.” That means avoiding sexually explicit content, hate speech and other things that might violate Facebook’s community standards. After describing the guidelines, Mosseri answered questions from CUNY’s Jeff Jarvis and other journalists. First up was a discussion of the recent test that removes Page posts (including those from news publishers) from the News Feed unless they’re promoted through advertising. For publishers worried that this means there will be no way for them to reach their audience on Facebook except through ad campaigns, Mosseri said, “I don’t think there’s any version of the world where we launch this as it is.” He didn’t get specific about how it would work when and if it rolls out more broadly. However, he did note that even though most of the discussion has focused on public versus private content, there’s also “hybrid” content, where (say) your mother posts a link from The New York Times. Presumably, those kinds of links would not be hidden by these potential changes. Jarvis also asked how Facebook’s partnerships with third-party fact checkers are going. Mosseri emphasized that these partnerships are just “the most tangible part of what we do” and “a much smaller part of a larger effort.” In fact, he said Facebook is trying to fight false news in a number of ways, including eliminating the financial incentives to post this news, reducing the distribution/ranking of false news (that’s where the outside party fact checkers fit in) and giving people more information and context about what they read. For what it’s worth, he said, “We haven’t seen huge flare ups” in false news this year, not even around some of the recent elections. He admitted Facebook can’t necessarily “claim too much credit” here, but it could be a sign that the company’s efforts to fight false news, as well as its public discussion of those efforts, are helping.  \n",

            "70 In Europe, Facebook’s data law buffer looks to be on borrowed time\n",
            "Facebook’s  European business may not, for too much longer, be able to rely on its preferred privacy buffer of arguing that data protection oversight of its business is exclusively limited to the Irish watchdog on account of its European HQ being located in Ireland. A non-binding legal opinion put out today by an influential advisor to Europe’s top court has ruled that the social network can in fact be subject to privacy oversight in other European Union Member States — at least where it has some physical presence (such as a sales office), as well as users whose data it is gathering for targeted advertising. The underlying case pertains to the background tracking of web browser users via Facebook operated cookies. A German education and training company which runs a fan page on Facebook had, in 2011, been ordered by a German data protection authority to deactivate the Facebook page because the latter deemed that neither it nor Facebook had informed users their personal data was being collected. The company challenged the order in court and, after much legal back and forth, several questions were referred to Europe’s top court for a preliminary ruling — which today’s advocate general opinion prefigures. In recent years, various European DPAs have sought to impose fines on Facebook for what they view as data protection violations pertaining to users in their jurisdiction, including watchdogs in Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium. But Facebook’s go-to rebuttal is to claim it is only subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish DPA. In today’s opinion, the advocate general writes: “In recent months, the supervisory authorities of several Member States have decided to impose fines on Facebook, because of breaches of the rules on the protection of the personal data of its users. The present case will enable the Court to clarify the extent of the powers of intervention of supervisory authorities such as ULD [German DPA] with regard to the processing of personal data which involves the participation of several parties.” It’s fair to say that EU Member States’ data protection authorities are a spectrum, with some taking a distinctly more proactively pro-privacy stance than others. While Ireland’s low corporate tax rate is something of a flag for where the country plants its priorities on the ‘data for businesses’ vs ‘privacy for users’ axis — underlining why Facebook might want to be subject to its supervision vs other, more pro-privacy EU DPAs. But its preference for the Irish data protection commissioner to be its sole privacy authority could well be on borrowed time. A spokeswoman for the ECJ said there is no date yet for a final judgment but one usually follows between three and six months after the opinion. Contacted for a response to today’s advocate general’s opinion, a Facebook spokesperson told us: “We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court’s decision.” Facebook’s spokesperson further emphasized the AG’s opinion is non-binding. However AG opinions are usually highly influential on the court — though we’ll have to wait to see whether the court concurs in this instance. (If so there could be wider implications for other, similarly structured tech companies that also use tracking cookies in the EU.) The Facebook spokesperson also sought to imply that the AG’s opinion is not consistent with an incoming update to EU data protection law, under the GDPR — which comes into force in May 2018, and includes a provision intended to reduce data oversight complexity for companies operating services across EU Member States borders via a so called one-stop shop mechanism that’s designed to limit the number of DPAs data controllers need to liaise with. However the mechanism does not mean data oversight is automatically limited to a single DPA; rather the GDPR provides for a lead DPA which can liaise with any other concerned authorities over data issues pertaining to citizens in their own territories. So in fact it allows for multiple concerned DPAs to carry out supervision on companies’ data-related practices. The AG also touches on this area, writing: “[T]he Court should not, in my opinion, pre-empt the scheme established by the general regulation on data protection which will apply from 25 May 2018 onwards. As part of that scheme a one-stop-shop mechanism is instituted. This means that a controller that carries out cross-border data processing, such as Facebook, will have only one supervisory authority as interlocutor, namely the lead supervisory authority, which will be the authority for the place where the controller’s main establishment is located. Nevertheless, that scheme, and the sophisticated cooperation mechanism which it introduces, are not yet applicable.” Another interesting component of the opinion pertains to the definition of a data controller — a key distinction in privacy law which enables supervisory authorities to understand where specific legal responsibilities lie, and thus how to apply data protection law. In the case of the German company involved in the original case, the AG’s view is that both it and Facebook share responsibility for data processing as regards the Facebook fan page, as both are involved with making decisions around how user data is processed (one as administer of the specific Facebook fan page; the other, Facebook, as administrating entity of Facebook fan pages). But the wider point of note is that neither needs to have complete control over data processing activities to be deemed a data controller from a legal point of view. “Ever more frequently data processing is complex, comprising several distinct processes which involve numerous parties which themselves have differing degrees of control. Consequently, any interpretation which focusses on the existence of complete control over all aspects of data processing is likely to result in serious lacunae in the protection of personal data,” writes the AG. “I would add that, as the Belgian Government rightly observes, the fact that the Wirtschaftsakademie [the German company in the case] acts as joint controller in so far as it decides to have recourse to Facebook’s services for its information offering in no way relieves Facebook Inc. or Facebook Ireland of their obligations as controllers. Indeed, it is clear that those two entities have a decisive influence over the purposes and means of the processing of personal data which occurs when a fan page is visited and that they also use that data for their own purposes and interests.” The AG also writes in support of “a broad interpretation of the concept of ‘controller’” saying this is necessary for EU data protection law to function as intended.  \n",

            "71 Facebook research automatically creates an avatar from a photo\n",
            "Creating avatars. Who’s got time for it?! Computers, that’s who. You’ll never have to waste another second selecting your hair style, skin tone or facial hair length if this research from Facebook  finds its way into product form. In a paper (PDF) presented at the International Conference on Computer Vision, Lior Wolf et al. show how they created a machine learning system that creates the best possible match of your real face to one in a custom emoji generator. You may be thinking: Wait, didn’t Google do this earlier in the year? Yes, kind of. But there’s a critical difference. Google’s version, while cool, used humans to rate and describe various features found in common among various faces: curly hair, nose types, eye shapes. These were then illustrated (quite well, I thought) as representations of that particular feature. Essentially, the computer looks for the tell-tale signs of a feature like freckles, then grabs the corresponding piece of art from its database. It works, but it’s largely reliant on human input for defining the features. Facebook’s approach was different. The idea being pursued was a system that really makes the best possible representation of a given face, using whatever tools it has at hand. So whether it’s emoji, Bitmoji (shudder), Mii, a VR face generator or anything else, it could still accomplish its task. To paraphrase the researchers, humans do it all the time, so why not AI? The system accomplishes this (to some degree) by judging both the face and the generated representation by the same analysis and feature identification algorithm, as if they were simply two pictures of the same person. When the resulting numbers generated by the two are as close as they seem likely to get, that means the two are visually similar to a sufficient degree. (At some point with these cartoon faces it isn’t going to get much better.) In this figure from the paper, the source images are at left, then manually configured emoji (not used in the system, just for comparison), then attempts by several variations of the algorithm, then similar attempts in a 3D avatar system. What’s great about this technique is that because it isn’t tied to any particular avatar type, it works (theoretically) on any of them. As long as there are good representations and bad ones, the system will match them with the actual face and figure out which is which. Facebook could use this information for many useful purposes — perhaps most immediately a bespoke emoji system. It could even update automatically when you put up a picture with a new haircut or trimmed beard. But the avatar-matching work could also be done for other sites — sign into whatever VR game with Facebook and have it immediately create a convincing version of yourself. And plenty of people out there surely wouldn’t mind if, at the very least, their emoji defaulted to their actual skin color instead of yellow. The full paper is pretty technical, but it was presented at an AI conference, so that’s to be expected.  \n",

            "72 Facebook attacks Pinterest with ‘Sets’ of posts\n",
            "Identity is prismatic. You show different sides of yourself to different friends in your life. Now Facebook wants to let you share the niches of your interests while stealing thunder from Pinterest’s  boards. Facebook is now testing a feature called Sets that lets you select several status updates, photos or videos and share them as a themed collection to everyone or specific friends. Facebook confirms to TechCrunch that Sets are testing in a few countries and provided this statement: “We’re testing a way for people to create sets of specific posts, photos and videos for just the friends that want to follow along.”  Facebook has been toying with ways to compete with Pinterest more directly for years now. It tried Collection ads that let people save items to a Wishlist section of their profile. In April, Instagram launched a bookmarking feature that lets you save posts to private collections. In the following months, Facebook tried letting you follow specific niche interests in News Feed with Topics, and add status updates to photo Albums. But Facebook’s Sets are much more akin to Pinterest’s boards that can made visible to others, so you could make a wedding planning Set to share with your significant other, a vacation Set of memories with your family or a fashion Set to show off your style. Sets were first spotted by tipsters Blake Tsuzaki and Taylor Lauren and reshared by Matt Navarra. Here’s how they work according to Facebook. Those with access will see the option to create a Set on their profile based around a theme of their choice. By default, Sets are visible to friends on your profile and in the News Feed. All your friends are defaulted to be “following” the Set so they’ll keep seeing updates about it, but they can unfollow so they’ll only see that Set on your profile and not in the News Feed. Facebook is also testing “Secret Sets” that default to only being visible to a private selection of friends you choose. Sets could give people ways to express themselves beyond the traditional News Feed posts that can feel clumsy if one of your hobbies isn’t of widespread interest amongst your friends. While a post about a niche interest might not get enough Likes to reach the friends who might care, Sets are designed for more targeted sharing. Facebook could eventually monetize the feature by offering a special button on product ads that save a business’ items to your Sets.  Facebook has found success by building good-enough versions of competitors’ products, like Instagram Stories, and is currently assaulting other tech giants like YouTube with Facebook Watch and Yelp with its restaurant discovery and food ordering options. It’s unlikely that Sets will displace Pinterest, but if Facebook can stunt its growth while helping users with self-expression, that may be sufficient.  \n",

            "73 Bipartisan bill seeks to regulate political ads on Facebook, Twitter and Google\n",
            "A new bipartisan bill known as the Honest Ads Act is the first major attempt to regulate online platforms that sell ads with rules akin to those that apply to more traditional advertising on TV, radio and in print. The bill, introduced today by Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar, with a bipartisan boost from Republican Senator John McCain, imposes regulations on social platforms, websites, ad networks and other online entities with more than 50 million unique users per month. As the bill’s announcement states: Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election by buying and placing political ads on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Google. The content and purchaser(s) of those online advertisements are a mystery to the public because of outdated laws that have failed to keep up with evolving technology. The Honest Ads Act would prevent foreign actors from influencing our elections by ensuring that political ads sold online are covered by the same rules as ads sold on TV, radio, and satellite. Disclosures for ad financing would apply to any entity that purchases more than $500 in ads cumulatively across a platform, a fairly low threshold for disclosure that speaks to the potency of even small ad buys on platforms like Facebook . The bill would also place a “reasonable expectation” on social media companies to identify if the source of an ad buy is outside the U.S. “There will always be a case where things can fall through the cracks. What we’re trying to do here is start with a light touch,” Warner said. “We don’t want to slow down innovation on the internet, we don’t want to slow down technology.” As the top Democrat on the Senate Intel Committee, Warner has had a front row seat to the revelations around Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. In their press conference announcing the bill, the senators noted that Google and Facebook command 85 percent of online political ads. “Who wouldn’t want to know if the ad appearing next to your story was being paid for by a foreign power?” Klobuchar asked. Its creators hope that the bill can make its way through Congress before primary season begins, fending off or at least complicating further attempts by the Russian government to seed divisive political ads online. Warner admitted that while the bill is a good start, it will still be difficult to identify accounts that are “misrepresenting themselves” to conceal where the money comes from. Calling the identity piece “much tougher,” Warner admits that he is “hoping that these platform companies come up with some ideas” for tracing and attributing political ad purchases. Sen. Klobuchar noted that tech companies may not be enthusiastic about facing increased regulation, but they have become increasingly cooperative after their initial reticence to admit fault. “Now the online companies, we’re working with them,” Klobuchar said. “I’m not going to tell you they support this bill right now. They have to realize that the world has changed, they have been selling ads and making money off of this system.” Even as they skewered Facebook for being “dismissive” early on and Twitter for essentially copying Facebook’s homework in its report to Congress a few weeks ago, the lawmakers appeared hopeful that cooperation would only improve as the depth of Russian election interference becomes more widely understood. In spite of that increasing cooperation, the senators suggested that voluntary adherence to Congressional guidelines would be an uneven solution at best. “The problem is, it has to cover everyone — you can’t just have a few companies doing it voluntarily, it has to be in the laws,” Warner said. “These companies rely on the trust of users,” he added. “It’s in their own self-interest.” Facebook, Twitter and Google are expected to appear in an open hearing before the House and Senate’s intelligence committees on November 1. Facebook and Twitter confirmed this week that they will not be sending high-profile executives to the hearings, instead opting to be represented by their general counsels. “I think that they got the message,” Warner said. “I think the real proof in the pudding will be ‘come to the hearing on November 1.’ “  \n",

            "74 Facebook Messenger lets games monetize with purchases and ads\n",
            "Facebook  is finally giving developers a reason to build games for Messenger while also opening a new revenue stream for the chat app. After launching HTML5 ‘Instant Games’ inside Messenger, like Pac-Man, Space Invaders and Words With Friends Frenzy in November 2016, today Facebook is allowing developers to add in-app purchases as well as interstitial and rewarded video ads. Players get a virtual good or bonus life in exchange for watching rewarded videos. Facebook will take a cut of the ads shown in Messenger games that are routed from its Facebook Audience Network, and they’ll begin appearing in some games on iOS and Android. In-app purchases will only start testing on Android, with Google Play taking its standard 30 percent cut. Facebook was cagey about how much of a cut of in-app purchase revenue it plans to take, repeatedly giving this vague statement when asked: “Our early tests for IAP will follow the standard rev/share policy and transaction fees for Google Play In-App billing.” For now it seems the remaining 70 percent goes to the developer, but Facebook will likely opt to take a portion of that when in-app purchases fully roll out. Developers who want access to the monetization beta program as Facebook rolls it out more widely can sign up here, while advertisers who don’t want their Audience Network ads appearing in games can opt out. Facebook plans to roll out ad measurement and optimization tools for game developers soon, plus ways to publish games to its directory more easily.  The move should attract higher-quality games to the Messenger platform, as until now, devs could only hope to build an audience and monetize down the line. Now with cash able to flow in through the games, it’s worth pouring more development resources into the platform. Previously, the only real way to earn money off these games was indirectly through branding, as with titles like Valerian Space Run, Wonder Woman and Lego Batman Bat Climb that promote movies. Messenger has had some missteps these past few years, with a half-baked roll out of bots that left many feeling they were dysfunctional, and a retreat from a redesign that over-prioritized the Messenger Camera. Facebook says Messenger Day has 70 million daily active users, but that means it has grown much slower than Instagram Stories, and it still feels a bit bolted on atop the inbox. Both bots and stories were potential vectors for monetization and now Facebook is looking elsewhere for revenue streams. Facebook seems to be taking Messenger Instant Games quite seriously after its desktop game platform withered and mobile gaming was dominated by the App Store and Google Play platforms. Facebook sees an opportunity to not only give people something to do between chat conversations and a way to challenge friends, but also now to start squeezing more cash out of the 1.3 billion Messenger users without interrupting the traditional use cases as its inbox ads do.  \n",

            "75 Facebook is now testing paywalls and subscriptions for Instant Articles\n",
            "A few months ago we reported that Facebook may begin testing paywalls and subscriptions for Instant Articles beginning in October. Well now it’s October, and surprise – Facebook  has started testing subscription support for instant articles! Here’s how it will work: Facebook will start with two paywalled options for publishers to choose from: The first option is a metered model where everyone gets to read 10 free stories per month before needing to subscribe. The second is a freemium model where the publishers choose which articles to lock. When someone who isn’t a subscriber hits one of these paywalls, they will be promoted to subscribe for full access to the publishers’ content. One really interesting aspect – if you want to purchase a subscription Facebook will direct you to the publisher’s website to complete the transaction, meaning they process the payment directly and can keep 100% of the revenue and transaction data. The subscriptions will then also include access to the publisher’s full site, and existing subscribers can also authenticate within Instant Articles so they can get full access without paying twice.  Redirecting users away from Facebook to complete a transaction is a huge win for publishers. But not everyone is happy with the arrangement. Notably, Recode reports that Apple is balking at the subscription signup flow, saying it violates the company’s rules about subscriptions sold inside apps. Right now Apple gets up to 30% of all subscriptions sold inside 3rd-party iOS apps, so Facebook’s current signup method would strip them of this revenue. For this reason the feature isn’t launching yet on Apple – only Android, which doesn’t have any restrictions on how subscriptions can be sold. There’s no timeline for when a deal could be made with Apple, with Facebook only saying that “this initial test will roll out on Android devices first , and we hope to expand it soon.” Facebook says many of their partner publishers identified subscriptions as a top priority, and especially requested the ability to maintain control over pricing, offers, and all the revenue generated from each subscription. The ten participating publishers at launch are Bild, The Boston Globe, The Economist, Hearst (The Houston Chronicle and The San Francisco Chronicle), La Repubblica, Le Parisien, Spiegel, The Telegraph, tronc (The Baltimore Sun, The Los Angeles Times, and The San Diego Union-Tribune), and The Washington Post. The tool will roll out over the next few weeks, and one a publisher is on board paywalls and subscriptions will immediately be available to all users seeing those stories.  \n",

            "76 Facebook and Google competed for anti-immigration ad dollars during the 2016 election\n",
            "In a textbook illustration of the conflict of interest between Facebook  and Google’s ostensible dedication to free speech and their ostensible espousal of progressive values, the internet giants reportedly took millions in advertising money from a major anti-immigration group at the same time as both were engaged in pro-immigration advocacy. Bloomberg reports that both companies worked with conservative nonprofit Secure America Now, which spent millions on ads on the platforms during the 2016 election. SAN’s ads, as far as they related to immigration and refugees, were execrable scaremongering, invoking the phantom threat of Sharia law being applied worldwide — the Mona Lisa wearing a niqab, for instance. And these weren’t merely banner ads placed on popular keywords for xenophobes. They were reportedly targeted and tested with plenty of help from Google  and Facebook. The former reportedly worked directly with SAN to improve the campaign, while the latter did extensive A/B testing to see if vertical video would do better. (Head of AR/VR and former head of ads Andrew Bosworth denied the company worked directly with SAN, but confirmed it worked with SAN’s ad agency. Google has since removed the ads.) A few short months later, in January, both companies spoke out forcefully against anti-immigration efforts, specifically the newly sworn-in President’s executive order that attempted (unsuccessfully) to ban immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries. Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post: We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat… We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That’s who we are. And Sundar Pichai in an internal memo: We’re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S….We’ve always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so. Am I the only one for whom these sentiments ring hollow considering that both companies had so recently been dancing for coins from a group whose sole purpose was to scare voters into choosing the candidate with the strong anti-immigration stance? I understand that it is a very difficult balance, to be a platform on which free speech is valued, but to have to run a business as well. You can’t turn your nose up at something that turns your stomach — not if the price is right. So the scammy apps, miracle diet pills, and conspiracy theories all get their ad spots just like Target and Newegg. But to take millions from a group one day, and then turn around the next to say you are deeply and fundamentally opposed to that group’s values — I’d like to say I don’t expect that kind of cynical hypocrisy, but that would be a lie. Why expect any better? On this and other issues, there seems to be little connection with what the public head of the company says, and what the guts of the company actually do. Whether it’s on accessibility, diversity, abuse, politics, finances, transparency, or any other issue: all you can trust that these companies will do is what’s best for the bottom line.  \n",

            "Facebook  has come under fire for its role in influencing the U.S. presidential election, particularly when it comes to “fake news” and Russian-sponsored ads.  When asked about this at WSJ D.Live in Laguna Beach on Wednesday, Facebook VP David Marcus at first deflected, talking at length about all the positive impacts that the social media giant has had on the world. “When you design a platform that reaches 2 billion people every month…sometimes bad things happen,” he concluded. Marcus said that Facebook is “collaborating with special counsel and Congress” to help evaluate Russia’s use of the platform for U.S. politics. He says it’s a priority of the company to “make sure that we build systems to prevent what happened from happening again.” Marcus oversees the Facebook Messenger platform and acknowledged that a “small number” of Russian-related incidents happened on the messenger service, but did not elaborate. He says that going forward, “we’re going to hire thousands of people to review ads and review all activities around notable elections around the world.” Marcus added that while “there’s no such thing as perfection,” he’s “absolutely confident that we have the right plan.”  \n",

            "78 Facebook officially rolls out its discovery-focused ‘Explore Feed’\n",
            "Facebook’s  tests of an alternative News Feed dubbed the “Explore” feed have progressed to a full rollout, the company now confirms. Previously available on mobile devices in the main navigation, Facebook’s new Explore Feed is now appearing for users on the desktop, as well. Facebook tells TechCrunch this is the beginning of the official rollout of the Explore feed. On the desktop, the feed is found in the left-side sidebar, within the “Explore” section – where you’ll also find links to Facebook features like Events, Groups, Pages, Moments, Saved items, and more. The expansion to desktop was first spotted via Matt Navarra, who shared a screenshot of the Explore Feed on Twitter. Facebook's Explore Feed is now on desktop, huh? pic.twitter.com/mgXs6tpapH — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) October 17, 2017  On mobile, the Explore feed is in the main navigation under the “More” menu. The idea behind the Explore Feed is to help Facebook users discover more content across the social network, beyond posts from friends and Pages you already follow. Instead, this feed surfaces recommended content it thinks you might find interesting, including posts, articles, photos and videos from sources you haven’t followed yet – like Facebook Pages and other posts from publishers or news organizations. The selection isn’t just random content, though. Items in the Explore Feed are similar to those you’ve already liked, or those popular among your network of friends, for example. The overall goal, of course, is to increase users’ time-on-site (or time-in-app, if on mobile). This allows Facebook to serve more ads in between the content, in videos and elsewhere. Effectively, it’s a second-tier News Feed that Facebook could monetize. At this time, however, the feed doesn’t appear to include advertising. (At least no ads appeared in tests after scrolling down for a good minute or so). The Explore Feed itself has been in testing for some time. Earlier this year, the feed was designated by a rocket ship icon, which may have confused users who didn’t understand its purpose. But other tests had labeled the feed “Explore,” which made more sense. That name has since stuck, as that’s how the feed is now labeled on desktop as well. When asked in the past about the feed’s expansion, Facebook had continued to say that the Explore Feed is just a test. That changed today. Reached for comment, a Facebook rep confirmed the Explore Feed is now being rolled out. “We are beginning to roll out a complementary feed of popular articles, videos, and photos, automatically customized for each person based on content that might be interesting to them,” the Facebook spokesperson said. “We’ve heard from people that they want an easy way to explore relevant content from Pages they haven’t connected with yet.” Post updated, 10/18/17, 2:30 pm et, with Facebook’s confirmation.   \n",

            "Facebook’s  Regina Dugan, who led the company’s secretive Building 8 hardware lab, is leaving the company after just 18 months in the role. Dugan detailed in a Facebook post that she would be leaving to focus on “building and leading a new endeavor.” She will be staying in her position until “early next year” to help the team transition into 2018.  Today I am announcing that early next year, I will be leaving Facebook to focus on building and leading a new endeavor…. Posted by Regina Dugan on Tuesday, October 17, 2017 As rumors pile up that Facebook is working on moving into consumer hardware, all eyes remain on the company’s Building 8 division, which handles those projects. Dugan presented onstage at Facebook’s F8 conference this year, talking about some of the company’s more long-shot projects, like embeddable brain sensors that could promote a more tight interface with hardware products. Before joining Facebook, Dugan was the head of Google’s Advanced Technology and Products team and was the director of DARPA before that. In August, it was reported that Facebook veteran Andrew Bosworth would be leading consumer hardware efforts at the company in a new role, overseeing teams like Building 8 and Oculus. It is not immediately clear who will be taking over the reins of the Building 8 lab from Dugan. We have reached out to Facebook for more information.  \n",

            "80 Facebook tests a resume “work histories” feature to boost recruitment efforts\n",
            "As LinkedIn ads in video and other features to look a little more like Facebook, Facebook  continues to take on LinkedIn in the world of social recruitment services. In the latest development, Facebook is testing a feature to let users create resumes — which Facebook calls a “work histories” feature — and share them privately on the site as part of their job hunt. First made public by The Next Web’s Matt Navarra on the back of a tip he received from a computer science student called Jane Manchun Wong, the test was confirmed to us by a spokesperson at the company as part of its efforts to grow usage of its recruitment advertising business, which was launched in February this year. “At Facebook, we’re always building and testing new products and services, ” he said. “We’re currently testing a work histories feature to continue to help people find and businesses hire for jobs on Facebook.” We’ve been looking around, and so far the only evidence of the test appears to be coming from an Android mobile device. Interestingly, Facebook is testing this resume service to reduce some of the friction between finding a job and then applying for it on mobile specifically, to make it easier and faster to apply for jobs with a ready-made career and education history. That is a use case that LinkedIn also identified a while back, using its basic profile pages as resume proxies in its own mobile-based job application flow. Facebook, of course, has a wider purpose than career advancement, so its basic profile pages don’t quite fit that need. On its surface, Facebook’s resume feature appears to be an expansion of the work and education details that you can already provide around your Facebook profile, including the period of time you’ve worked in a job or studied somewhere, and your contact information: In the case of the resume, though, the key difference is that the information doesn’t post directly to your profile. Today, users only have two options for handling that kind of information: either making it completely public, or just visible to your friends (but not entirely visible unless you choose to share it). The resume will have a more targeted use: you can show it off only when you choose to, as part of a job application. Facebook took its initial step into the recruitment market in February this year when it launched its first job ads as a basic page that let you look for jobs they way you might look for goods for sale on Facebook’s Marketplace: by location and keywords. In the months since then, it’s worked on several tests and expansions of the service to figure out how to get more traffic to this new part of its site. They have included plans to connect users in mentorships to help create a wider culture of career advancement on the platform (something LinkedIn has also been building); and ramping up the volume of job ads on Facebook by way of a partnership with ZipRecruiter, an aggregator that lets businesses post to Facebook’s job site along with dozens of other online job boards. One notable thing to me about Facebook’s recruitment efforts is that while they have the  potential to take on LinkedIn in the world of white-collar jobs, Facebook is taking a very mass-market approach: in my area, I’ve seen jobs for lawyers and designers, but also bus drivers, housekeepers and other service workers. In a sense, it makes this not unlike the approach that Facebook has taken with Workplace as a competitor to Slack: the latter has positioned itself as a communications tool for the professional class of workers, the former is trying to target them, but also everyone else. (And now those businesses can also use the platform to recruit more.) Another notable data point: just as Facebook’s collecting of profile interests helps the company build out its social graph and data points for advertising and more, so could this resume builder help the company develop better ideas of where to target its job ads, as well as other kinds of advertising aiming at particular demographics. It remains to be seen how far Facebook will be willing to go to grow its footprint in the very crowded area of online recruitment, which already has a number of huge players including Randstad (which owns Monster.com) and Recruit (which owns Indeed.com), among many more. In Facebook’s favor, though, there is definitely a case of noise and signal when it comes to recruitment, and social networks have had a much higher hit-rate when it’s come to getting qualified leads for open positions.  “People are interacting on a wide variety of subjects, not just jobs, so it feels very organic,” said Ian Siegel, the CEO of ZipRecruiter. He told TechCrunch that social platforms tend to perform well in recruitment because employees can tap their networks and so inbound interest tends to be less random. “They deliver good quality candidates,” Siegel said. “People who come through the network of current employees can be vouched for.”  \n",

            "81 Facebook acquires anonymous teen compliment app tbh, will let it run\n",
            "Facebook wants tbh to be its next Instagram. Today, Facebook announced it’s acquiring positivity-focused polling startup tbh and will allow it to operate somewhat independently with its own brand. tbh had scored 5 million downloads and 2.5 million daily active users in the past nine weeks with its app that lets people anonymously answer kind-hearted multiple-choice questions about friends who then receive the poll results as compliments. You see questions like “Best to bring to a party?,” “Their perseverance is admirable?” and “Could see becoming a poet?” with your uploaded contacts on the app as answer choices. tbh has racked up more than 1 billion poll answers since officially launching in limited states in August, mostly from teens and high school students, and spent weeks topping the free app charts. When we profiled tbh last month in the company’s first big interview, co-creator Nikita Bier told us, “If we’re improving the mental health of millions of teens, that’s a success to us.”  Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but TechCrunch has heard the price paid was less than $100 million and won’t require any regulatory approval. As part of the deal, tbh’s four co-creators — Bier, Erik Hazzard, Kyle Zaragoza and Nicolas Ducdodon — will join Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters while continuing to grow their app with Facebook’s cash, engineering, anti-spam, moderation and localization resources. However, the tbh founders will become formal Facebook employees, with Facebook email addresses, opposed to running more independently like Instagram and WhatsApp, which have their own buildings and emails. The tbh team wrote in an announcement post that “When we met with Facebook, we realized that we shared many of the same core values about connecting people through positive interactions. Most of all, we were compelled by the ways they could help us realize our vision and bring it to more people.” In a statement to TechCrunch, Facebook wrote: “tbh and Facebook share a common goal — of building community and enabling people to share in ways that bring us closer together. We’re impressed by the way tbh is doing this by using polling and messaging, and with Facebook’s resources tbh can continue to expand and build positive experiences.” It’s interesting that Facebook opted to acquire tbh rather than clone it, since it has been aggressively copying other hit teen apps like Houseparty recently. While Facebook’s Snapchat clone Instagram Stories has achieved massive popularity, other knock-offs it has made haven’t fared as well. With tbh’s strong brand name, distinctive design and explosive early traction, Facebook seems to have decided it was better to team-up than face-off.  [Correction: tbh has 2.5 million daily active users, not 4 million as we originally published after Bier implied as much in a tweet he deleted after this article was published.] Bier originally started tbh parent company Midnight Labs back in 2010. The app studio tried a slew of products, including a personal finance app, a college chat app and a personality test. Eventually the company took a small seed round in 2013 from investors, including Greylock via partner Josh Elman, Bee Partners and Indicator Ventures. But nothing took off, and Midnight Labs was running out of money. With just 60 days of cash left, the company decided to build something at the intersection of the positivity it saw lacking in anonymous apps like Secret and Yik Yak, and the honesty teens craved as seen in the TBH trend where social network users request candid feedback from their friends: tbh was born. “We shipped it to one school in Georgia. Forty percent of the school downloaded it the first day,” said Bier. 📥 Introducing DMs on tbh. Slide on in. pic.twitter.com/ZLBNzbcUW3 — tbh app (@thetbhapp) October 10, 2017  The biggest problem quickly became how to keep users engaged with the app; tbh already limits you to answering a few questions at a time, so you beg for more. Its first big feature release came this week with the addition of direct messaging. This lets you message someone who chose you as an answer, and they have the option of revealing their identity to you. But trying to simultaneously keep the servers online, write new questions and build the next sticky feature was a tall task for such a small team. Now tbh will have Facebook to help it scale while keeping existing users entertained. The app will remain free to download on iOS and Android, and the brand will remain the same.  Having the backup from Facebook should let Bier and his team breathe a little easier. There’s a lot of advantages to joining forces with Facebook: These resources have helped Instagram grow well over 10X its size, to 800 million users, since Facebook bought it in 2012, while WhatsApp has grown from 450 million to 1.3 billion users since Facebook acquired it in 2014. But rather than waiting and watching until tbh climbed to be worth nearly $1 billion like Instagram or $19 billion like WhatsApp, Facebook swooped in early. The last thing it needed was tbh ending up being bought by Snapchat.  “Nikita and his team have figured out a lot about how teens are using products. This is one of the few that’s gotten this kind of adoption, and that should be celebrated,” tbh investor Josh Elman says. “Hopefully this shows that there’s still room to get lots of people adopting new mobile experiences.” Before tbh, most social media was about competing for likes or glorifying your offline life. But those little dopamine-inducing notifications had little true connection on the other side, and it’s easy to think you’re uncool when everyone else seems to be having so much fun. Indeed, tbh filled the gap between being “liked” and actually feeling appreciated. “We think the next milestone is thinking about social platforms in terms of love and positivity,” Bier told me. “We think that’s what’s been missing from social products since the inception of the internet.” For more on tbh, read our interview with its co-founder about its creation and mission.  \n",

            "82 Facebook’s ‘Order Food’ feature officially launches across the US\n",
            "Facebook  today formally announced its new feature that allows users to order food from local restaurants using its app. Instead of competing directly with other food ordering services, Facebook is partnering with several industry players on this effort, including EatStreet, Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow, Olo, Zuppler and Slice. It’s also working with restaurant chains directly, like Jack in the Box, Five Guys, Papa John’s, Wingstop, TGI Friday’s, Denny’s, El Pollo Loco, Chipotle, Jimmy John’s and Panera. Users can find the new option “Order Food” in the Explore menu in the Facebook app, where you can then browse area restaurants and click “Start Order” when you know what you want. Orders can be placed for either take-out or delivery, and if you already have a Delivery.com account, you can use your existing login. If not, you’ll be able to sign up for a Delivery.com account directly in the Facebook app, the company says. In addition, you’ll be able to read reviews from friends about the restaurant in question, to help you make your decision.  Facebook has been developing a deeper relationship with food ordering businesses for some time. Last fall, it announced a deal with online ordering services Delivery.com and Slice, which allowed Facebook users to place orders from supported restaurants through their own Facebook Pages. Earlier this year, TechCrunch reported this “Order Food” feature was in testing as a new option from within the Explore menu in the app. Facebook, at the time, confirmed it was an expansion of its previous “Order Food” functionality via the Facebook Pages. The idea was to see if adding an entry point through Facebook’s main navigation could increase the usage for the food ordering feature. The company, however, did not comment on how long the option had been live, or what percentage of Facebook users had it available. Today, Facebook confirms that the Order Food option has been in testing since last year, and, after adding more partners and responding to user feedback, it’s rolling out across the U.S. to all users on iOS, Android and desktop.  Food Ordering Posted by Facebook on Thursday, October 12, 2017 The move to introduce food ordering is one that allows Facebook to keep users inside its app for longer periods, instead of seeing users exit to other apps for common tasks, like ordering a pizza. The company has been rolling out several other features with that same goal, including things like weather info, instant games, a jobs board, fundraisers, movie listings, booking appointments and getting quotes and more. However, “Order Food” is not a direct revenue driver for Facebook. The company confirmed that it doesn’t charge any fees, or share in any portion of the profits from the orders placed via its social network.  \n",

            "83 Facebook’s ad targeting tools could be a valuable supplement to census data\n",
            "Official census forms are an invaluable source for demographic data throughout the country, but for trends that occur on the scale of weeks or months rather than years, they’re a bit lacking. But a new study shows that similar data used by Facebook  to target ads could help fill in that blind spot. Sociologist Emilio Zagheni at the University of Washington looked into the possibility, in this case specifically regarding migrants in the U.S. and their movements between states. He’s previously looked at this topic using Google+ and other internet-based metrics. Say you wanted to know whether East African migrant populations were tending toward settling in cities, suburbs or rural areas. The census process is completed every decade, which really is too long a time to observe short-term trends that follow, for example, an economic recovery or important bill. But by using, or rather strategically misusing Facebook’s Ads Manager tool, one can find reasonably accurate and up-to-date info on, for example, Somalian migrants to the Chicago metro area versus outside the city. Facebook has already extracted all this data — why not use it? This data is, of course, not the whole picture. You’re not finding all Somalian folks in the Chicago area, only Facebook users who choose to accurately report their country of origin and current location. Compared with the data in the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, it’s not very reliable. But it’s still valuable, Zagheni argues. “Is it better to have a large sample that is biased, or a small sample that is nonbiased?” he asks in a UW news release. “The American Community Survey is a small sample that is more representative of the underlying population; Facebook is a very large sample but not representative. The idea is that in certain contexts, the sample in the American Community Survey is too small to say something significant. In other circumstances, Facebook samples are too biased.” “With this project we aim at getting the best of both worlds,” he continues. “By calibrating the Facebook data with the American Community Survey, we can correct for the bias and get better estimates.” Facebook trends mirror the census data, but tend to underestimate numbers. With reliable but scarce ground truth data and noisy but voluminous supplementary data, you can put together a more precise picture than before — as long as you’re careful to control for those biases. Data from other social networks could also be brought in to even things out. Zagheni and his team hope to refine the ideas demonstrated in the paper so that they can be applied in places like developing countries where self-reported data like Facebook’s is easy to come by but reliable government data isn’t. A “good enough” sketch of the population and recent trends could help with things like prioritizing infrastructure investment or directing aid. It’s unfortunate that the whole thing required the researchers to abuse the advertising system to expose the data — surely Facebook can provide better access for research purposes. I asked the company whether that was a likely possibility. Zagheni seemed to like the idea. “I certainly hope that there will be opportunities to work directly with Facebook on this line of research in the future,” he wrote in an email to TechCrunch. The paper describing the team’s work is published in the latest issue of the journal Population and Development Review.  \n",

            "84 The trouble with Sandberg saying Facebook allows fake news ads\n",
            "If the Russian-bought election interference ads hadn’t been bought by fraudulent accounts, “Most of them would be allowed to run” Facebook  COO Sheryl Sandberg said this morning. “The responsibility of an open platform is to allow people to express themselves” she said during the first of an Axios interview series with Facebook execs. “The thing about free expression is when you allow free expression you allow free expression,” Sandberg said, noting that “we don’t check what people post” and that she doesn’t think people should want Facebook to. The linchpin quote of the interview was when Sandberg said “The question is should divisive, political, or issue ads run … our answer is yes, because when you cut off speech for one person, then you cut off speech for all people.” The perspective maintains Facebook’s neutrality across the political spectrum and absolves it from being the truth police. But it also means that it’s knowingly creating a platform where people can misinform each other. That raises the question of how free speech scales to user-generated content sharing networks that lack the curation and editorial oversight of traditional news distribution systems. Sandberg dodged Axios editor Mike Allen’s question about whether Facebook is a media company, and wasn’t pressed about how it accepts money for ads like other media companies. Facebook plans to hire 1,000 more human moderators to protect election integrity, make all ads transparent to everyone rather than visible just to those targeted, and increase scrutiny on political ad buys. But can the fake news issue ever be solved if Facebook actually permits fake news under the banner of free speech? Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch During her talk, Sandberg also confirmed that Facebook will support the plan of congressional investigators probing election interference to release the Russian-bought ads to the public. She said she met with Congress yesterday, Facebook is fully cooperating, and that it will provide Congress any content investigators want. That includes non-ads. “A lot of them, if they were run by legitimate people, we would let them run,” Sandberg explained. She also said targeting information about the ads will be released to the public, as well. “We have a responsibility to do everything we can do to prevent this kind of abuse,” said Sandberg. “We’re hoping to set a new standard in transparency in advertising.” Though at the same time, she blatantly dodged a question about whether the Russian-bought ads and Donald Trump’s campaign ads had matching targeting. As for the accusation that Facebook causes filter bubbles by surrounding us with information shared by our social graph instead of a more impartial news source, Sandberg said Facebook actually broadens our perspective through exposure to our weak ties and acquaintances. She cited studies showing we see a wider view of the news through the lens of Facebook than traditional sources. You can watch the full talk with Sandberg below:  Exclusive interview with Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg WATCH LIVE: Axios' exclusive interview with Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg  as public scrutiny intensifies over Russia's use of the platform. Posted by Axios on Thursday, October 12, 2017 Sandberg’s comments come alongside newly exposed information about the effectiveness of Facebook’s fight against fake news. In an email obtained by BuzzFeed, Facebook’s manager of news partnerships Jason White wrote to one of the company’s third-party fact checkers: “Once we receive a false rating from one of our fact checking partners, we are able to reduce future impressions on Facebook by 80 percent . . . we are working to surface these hoaxes sooner. It commonly takes over 3 days, and we know most of the impressions typically happen in that initial time period.” But while Facebook is willing to demote the News Feed prominence of a news story that’s unequivocally established as false by third parties, it still allows this content on its platform. This all boils down to the fact that Facebook’s News Feed is sorted by engagement. Normally, low quality content simply receives too few Likes or comments to be seen by many people. But fake news is so tantalizing in how it stokes our biases and political leanings that it breaks this system. People will click-through, Like, and share this content because they agree with or are entertained by it, not because it’s high quality. This, in turn, incentivizes publishers of false news hoaxes. Facebook demotes hoaxes when identified, and is blocking monetization and ad buys from these publishers. But these mechanics also incentivize publishing of highly polarized opinion, exaggeration, and sensationalism. And when advertisers pay to boost the reach of fake news, its click-baitness attains these ads a level of engagement that wins them a lower price in Facebook’s auction system. That’s how Facebook profits from fake news and polarization, even as it vows to work harder to protect us from it. While Facebook might want to offer an open platform where it’s not the opinion police or even the truth police, it’s simultaneously earning money from some of the most malicious uses of free expression.  It’s all a slippery slope. One person’s fake news busting is another’s censorship. But at the same time, Facebook is not legally obligated to maintain a free speech platform. Its rules prohibiting nudity, hate speech, and graphic imagery for the sake of ‘safety’ already show it’s willing to make judgement calls about when free speech crosses the line. But fake news is unsafe too. Some critics take a cynical approach, saying Facebook cracks down harder on that stuff because it scares away advertisers, while fake news actually brings in dollars. It’s certainly true that it’s easier to detect those banned content types at scale with algorithms searching for nipples, racial slurs, and blood. Yet even if Facebook could reliably spot not just unabashedly false news but sensationalized content, its current policy is to allow it as long as it doesn’t preach violence or pure hate. Something has to change. Sandberg said the public deserves “Not just an apology, but determination” to fix the problem. Now it’s time to see that determination in action. In my opinion, either: Or Or at least All of these enforcement options could potentially ensnare legitimate news, be misused by trolls, or prevent innocent ad buys. But if Facebook commits to minimizing these false positives, the result could better protection for democracy and civil society compared to the alternative of knowingly allowing false news to proliferate in the name of free speech.  \n",

            "85 After Sandberg chat, House intel plans to release Russian-bought Facebook ads to the public\n",
            "After its Senate counterpart made clear that it had no intention of doing so, the House Intelligence Committee announced that it plans to publish the Russian-bought Facebook ads that the company provided as part of the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The news comes on the heels of a meeting between Facebook  COO Sheryl Sandberg and the House’s intel leads, Chairman Mike Conaway and ranking Democrat Adam Schiff. “We will be releasing them from our committee,” Schiff said. “We’ve asked for Facebook’s help to help scrub any personally identifiable information, but it’s our hope that when they conclude, then we can release them publicly.” Last week, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr stated definitively that his committee was not at liberty to publish the 3,000 ads in question and that it did not make a practice of releasing documents provided to it during the course of an investigation. The Senate committee called on Facebook as well as Twitter and Google to release any ads with links to Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election to the public. Those tech companies have yet to do so, which some in the legal community believe is due to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), a 1986 wiretapping law that is still consulted as a legal framework in many online privacy matters. The ads will likely be released after November 1, the date that Facebook, Twitter and Google are expected to appear in open hearings as part of the House and Senate’s respective Russia investigations.  \n",

            "86 Facebook’s new virtual reality strategy: self-reliance\n",
            "Today, Facebook’s VR ambitions looked inwards. The newly announced $199 Oculus Go headset and upcoming high-end “Santa Cruz” standalone will come with something past headsets haven’t: power buttons. By controlling the end-to-end experience, Facebook  gets to tackle VR with a Cupertino-like approach to hardware that lets them avoid the headaches of Windows/Android and the OEMs that build for them. While the company’s past efforts have been intricately tied to the fractured smartphone and PC markets, Facebook made clear Wednesday that their future is wireless, uniform and all about their platform. Oculus Go will save Facebook from having to build complex partnerships with smartphone manufacturers that are 100x easier for Google to gain through Android anyway. Samsung is Oculus’s only friend when it comes to mobile VR, and this year the company put both of its flagship smartphones on Google Daydream, as well. This move could likely signal a future where Oculus moves away from smartphone mobile VR as they shift to building their own platforms and letting Google dominate VR on Android, which was a bit of an inevitability anyway. The high-end “Santa Cruz” headset doesn’t need Windows and will instead rely on onboard compute. Oculus was more than a little vague in how they portrayed the device, so I won’t assume too much, but there’s little doubt that the headset will be less powerful as a standalone than what the Rift can currently handle. That may end up disappointing die-hards, but subtle movements of the high-end market away from being tethered to a PC is going to do Facebook a lot of favors in terms of platform sustainability and leaving the early-adopter niche. The thing is, there’s been this misconception that Valve or Samsung or Microsoft or Sony are Oculus’s competitors, when the fact is that their main competitor is irrelevancy. Zuck introduces the $199 Oculus Go headset What’s important is that these moves isolate Facebook and Oculus from other tech giants getting cold feet in the race to build VR tech. With standalone headsets, Facebook can take its massive war chest and the billions of dollars it’s already pledged and put on its blinders, undercutting competitors’ prices and plugging ahead even if headset numbers fail to immediately impress. Mark Zuckerberg seems unlikely to shift his assertion that VR is the future, and with that steadfastness, if there’s a market in VR, Facebook will likely be the one to realize it, both on the hardware side with Oculus and what Facebook has shown with software like Spaces. Facebook bought Oculus VR more than three years ago and the ride since has been pretty bumpy. Scandals, product delays, executive overhauls and expensive lawsuits have all partially defined the company’s VR ambitions thus far. What comes next is anyone’s guess, but for Facebook it will finally be their choice to make.  \n",

            "Facebook  wants to let you create virtual objects in its Oculus Medium sculpting platform or Facebook Spaces VR hangouts and then share them with friends who don’t have a VR headset. Today at Oculus Connect 4, Facebook previewed 3D posts, a new type of News Feed post where users can grab, spin and interact with a 3D object to look at it from all angles. Below you can see how you can pinch, zoom and rotate the objects in 3D posts. In terms of social sharing, Facebook announced 3D posts, letting users interact with 3D objects without a headset pic.twitter.com/WhZXGlVta2 — Eva Hoerth (@downtohoerth) October 11, 2017  And rather than the objects just being static, you can actually open and close toy car doors, pose figures and more. #3D posts come to the Facebook News Feed! Create objects in #VR and share to Facebook for anyone to see and interact with. pic.twitter.com/kqOXHp93zE — Ben Smith (@benasmith) October 11, 2017  Users will be able to create objects in Medium or Spaces’ marker drawing feature and then share them to the News Feed. And down the line, Facebook is working on an API to let third-party VR app developers give users the option to share their creations to the News Feed.  Facebook Spaces masks Facebook will also soon allow augmented reality objects recorded with Facebook Camera to be shared into Facebook Spaces so you can play with AR in VR. These posts can already be shared to the News Feed from Facebook Camera. Spaces is also getting a bunch of new features. Beyond 2D Facebook Live broadcasts, Facebook Spaces users will soon be able to share 360 Live videos from inside virtual reality. Facebook has now cloned Snapchat’s famous AR masks and brought them to VR by letting your Spaces avatar try on different masks with themes like animals. There’s now dice, playing cards and drawing features. And in the coming weeks, you’ll be able to combine virtual objects you make or select into a “kit” that can be saved and opened up later so you can keep track of the pieces of your favorite VR costume or a self-made board game. Soon you’ll be able to compile VR objects into a saveable Facebook Spaces Kit you can open and play with later Facebook Spaces users will be able to interact with Oculus Quill illustrations made in VR. And Facebook is starting a “Build With Us” campaign that will let more developers create simple games or table-top versions of their immersive VR games for Facebook Spaces. All these features will give people more to do in Spaces, so there’s a real reason to get your friends to all put their headsets on and hang out synchronously no matter where in the world they are. The adoption of virtual reality hasn’t happened quite as quickly as many people expected. Facebook acquired Oculus more than three years ago, but headsets are still selling somewhat slowly. That makes all the imaginative content and games people produce for VR limited to a small audience. The 3D posts unveiled today radically expand the number of people who can play with things made in VR by letting this content escape the headset.  Facebook actually first allowed 3D objects to be interacted with in the feed via 3D embeds from Sketchfab back in 2015. But now Facebook has built a standardized 3D format on top of which it can build more 3D creation tools. Facebook found that it could only create a constantly churning, always-interesting News Feed by convincing the whole world to make and share content. Now it’s embarking on a similar quest for VR. Rather than the company or a few big-name developers building everything in VR, the idea is that users themselves will be able to create objects, games, art and more. That could turn VR from a top-down, impersonal broadcast medium into a peer-to-peer network that gets better with each new person who enters the metaverse.  \n",

            "Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced today that his company is working with the American Red Cross to target aid efforts in Puerto Rico using artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to identify areas to deliver aid. “We use artificial intelligence to build what we call ‘population maps’ so you can look at satellite imagery of an area and get a sense of where it is that people actually live and the density of different places and where’s there’s infrastructure going to in those places,” Zuckerberg said. “That’s going to help the Red Cross figure out where people are who need help.” What was perhaps most peculiar about the announcement was that it was given by a cartoonish Mark Zuckerberg avatar speaking from the company’s Spaces virtual reality app that runs on the Oculus Rift headset.  Oculus is having its developer conference this week so it’s not entirely out of left field, but seeing a cartoon avatar in the middle of an NPR-produced 360 video highlighting the situation in Puerto Rico while very real people walk around surveying the devastation of their homes perhaps wasn’t the most appropriate choice. Nevertheless, Zuckerberg referenced the company’s efforts in activating functionality like Safety Check so people could alert FB friends that they were safe, while also utilizing Community Help feature to help organize aid efforts in Puerto Rico. Importantly, Zuck also highlighted that Facebook donated $1.5 million to relief efforts and sent a number of employees down to the island to help ensure that networks were up so that relief efforts could be coordinated more easily.  \n",

            "90 Facebook quietly launches Mac and PC Workplace Chat apps with screen share\n",
            "TechCrunch has discovered that Facebook  has stealthily launched official desktop PC and Mac chat apps with screen sharing — two features users have been begging for. Right now, they’re only available for Workplace, Facebook’s enterprise collaboration software that competes with Slack and other business apps. But users would surely enjoy if the consumer Messenger app got its own desktop app and screen sharing options one day. Workplace has over 14,000 businesses on board paying $1 to $3 per user, and recently signed up Wal-Mart. Screensharing could help Workplace attract more clients and disrupt the clunky screen sharing of enterprise apps like Skype and WebEx. It’s clear that Facebook is applying its rapid development style in an bid to conquer offices with an all-in-one collaboration app while competitors only offer a piece of the puzzle.  Buried in the help section of Workplace, TechCrunch spotted a download link for the beta version of the Workplace Chat desktop app for both PC and Mac. It makes it easy to message with co-workers throughout the day without relying on a browser tab that can get lost amongst all your other tabs. Workplace by Facebook spokesperson Vanessa Chan confirmed the launch of the desktop app to TechCrunch, saying “This was one of the most widely requested features by customers, so we built it. The desktop app is still in beta and being tested by Workplace customers who are providing feedback that we’ll use to improve the product before a wider rollout.”  The desktop app works similarly to Workplace Chat’s dedicated website, which in turn is modeled after Messenger.com. It provides a big dashboard of all your conversations, text search, and the typical photo, video, voice clip, emoji, GIF, and web cam sharing. You can also set up desktop notifications that ride over your other windows so you never miss a message. Workplace Chat is one of Facebook’s only pieces of desktop software besides its casual gaming platform Facebook Gameroom. Facebook tried offering a Messenger for Windows app in 2012 before shutting it down in 2014. Since then, several convincing but fake third-party desktop apps have proliferated. The Messenger team has been largely focused on mobile rather than desktop or even web features. Now that it has 1.3 billion monthly users, though, it could potentially explore desktop software to keep growing.  What’s totally new to Facebook is screen sharing. As Facebook evolves from text towards visual communication, being able to show people what you’re looking at could be an important complement to video chat. While Slack only added screen sharing in May over four years after launch, Workplace now has it less than a year after its debut.  Screen sharing is now available on both the Workplace Chat desktop apps and on web. Not only can you share your full-screen, but you can select to only share a specific desktop app you’re running. That could be invaluable if you want to avoid embarrassing yourself or exposing sensitive work data or communications. For example, you might only share Excel or your web browser, but not Slack or your email client. Establishing this level of privacy for screen sharing is important since that’s one of the biggest concerns of clients using office software made by Facebook. It’s the reason that Facebook does not directly integrate your normal social network profile with Workplace, opting to keep them completely separate. Just because a News Feed and instant messaging are useful for work doesn’t mean you want your boss seeing how you socialize.  Overall, the new desktop software gives Workplace a preferred spot on your computer when it might otherwise drown within Chrome or Firefox. Combining the familiarity of Facebook’s design with the prominence of dedicated desktop apps could encourage the constant collaboration the company hopes to enable. Workplace is designed not just for traditional white-collar office employees but to allow everyone in a company from top to bottom to communicate. That’s why additional access points are important. While most enterprise software is thought of as ugly and inconvenient, Workplace is flipping that idea on its face.  \n",

            "91 Facebook tries fighting fake news with publisher info button on links\n",
            "Facebook  thinks showing Wikipedia entries about publishers and additional Related Articles will give users more context about the links they see. So today it’s beginning a test of a new “i” button on News Feed links that opens up an informational panel. “People have told us that they want more information about what they’re reading” Facebook product manager Sara Su tells TechCrunch. “They want better tools to help them understand if an article is from a publisher they trust and evaluate if the story itself is credible.”  This box will display the start of a Wikipedia entry about the publisher and a link to the full profile, which could help people know if it’s a reputable, long-standing source of news…or a newly set up partisan or satire site. It will also display info from their Facebook Page even if that’s not who posted the link, data on how the link is being shared on Facebook, and a button to follow the news outlet’s Page. If no Wikipedia page is available, that info will be missing, which could also provide a clue to readers that the publisher may not be legitimate. Meanwhile, the button will also unveil Related Articles on all links where Facebook can generate them, rather than only if the article is popular or suspected of being fake news as Facebook had previously tested. Trending information could also appear if the article is part of a Trending topic. Together, this could show people alternate takes on the same news bite, which might dispute the original article or provide more perspective. Previously Facebook only showed Related Articles occasionally and immediately revealed them on links without an extra click. The changes are part of Facebook big, ongoing initiative to improve content integrity\n",
            "Of course, whenever Facebook shows more information, it creates more potential vectors for misinformation. “This work reflects feedback from our community, including publishers who collaborated on the feature development as part of the Facebook Journalism Project” says Su. When asked about the risk of the Wikipedia entries that are pulled in having been doctored with false information, a Facebook spokesperson told me “Vandalism on Wikipedia is a rare and unfortunate event that is usually resolved quickly. We count on Wikipedia to quickly resolve such situations and refer you to them for information about their policies and programs that address vandalism.” And to avoid distributing fake news, Facebook says Related Articles will “be about the same topic — and will be from a wide variety of publishers that regularly publish news content on Facebook that get high engagement with our community.” “As we continue the test, we’ll continue listening to people’s feedback to understand what types of information are most useful and explore ways to extend the feature” Su tells TechCrunch. “We will apply what we learn from the test to improve the experience people have on Facebook, advance news literacy, and support an informed community.” Facebook doesn’t expect the changes to significantly impact the reach of Pages, though publishers that knowingly distribute fake news could see fewer clicks if the Info button repels readers by debunking the articles. Getting this right is especially important after the fiasco this week when Facebook’s Safety Check for the tragic Las Vegas mass-shooting pointed people to fake news. If Facebook can’t improve trust in what’s shown in the News Feed, people might click all its links less. That could hurt innocent news publishers, as well as reducing clicks to Facebook’s ads. Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Facebook initially downplayed the issue of fake news after the U.S. presidential election where it was criticized for allowing pro-Trump hoaxes to proliferate. But since then, the company and Mark Zuckerberg have changed their tunes. The company has attacked fake news from all angles, using AI to seek out and downrank it in the News Feed, working with third-party fact checkers to flag suspicious articles, helping users more easily report hoaxes, detecting news sites filled with low-quality ads, and deleting accounts suspected of spamming the feed with crap. Facebook’s rapid iteration in its fight against fake news shows its ability to react well when its problems are thrust into the spotlight. But these changes have only come after the damage was done during our election, and now Facebook faces congressional scrutiny, widespread backlash, and is trying to self-regulate before the government steps in. The company needs to more proactively anticipate sources of disinformation if its going to keep up in this cat-and-mouse game against trolls, election interferers, and clickbait publishers.  \n",

            "In an update on the progress of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, the Senate Intelligence Committee weighed in on recent revelations that have implicated major tech companies. The committee plans to hear open public testimony from Facebook, Twitter and Google on November 1 pertaining to their role in selling political ads to Russian government entities and fostering an environment in which shadowy foreign-funded political propaganda efforts could thrive. According to the chairman, Richard Burr, it took time for tech leaders to warm up to the notion that they were responsible for influence campaigns run on their platforms. “I was concerned at first that some social media platforms did not take this threat seriously enough,” Burr said. “The three companies we’ve invited, Google, Twitter and Facebook,  will appear in a public hearing.” Burr made it clear that his committee could not release the ads that Facebook handed over as part of the investigation, but Facebook and the other companies are not constrained by the committee from doing so. “We don’t release documents provided by to our committee, period,” Burr said. “[It’s] not a practice that we’re going to get into. Clearly if any of the social media platforms would like to do that, we’re fine with them doing it because we’ve already got scheduled an open hearing. We believe that the American people deserve to know firsthand.” Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner echoed Burr’s statement. “There will be more forensics done by these companies,” Warner said. “I think they’ve got some more work to do and I’m pleased to say I think they’re out doing that work now.” “At the end of the day it’s important that the public sees these ads,” he added. The committee is focused on three areas of the Russian ad scandal. First, Burr and Warner stated that Americans have a right to know the source of social media ads and if they were created by “foreign entities.” Second, when a story is trending, the committee believes that Americans should be able to determine if that trending topic is a result of bots or otherwise artificial engagement. Third, “you ought to be able to go down and take a look at an ad run for or against you like you’d be able to get a look at that content on TV,” Burr said. The committee reiterated that its investigation had made it clear that Russia’s efforts to interfere with the American political process are ongoing. “The Russian active measures efforts did not end on election day 2016,” Warner said. “We need to be on guard.” For its part, Facebook tried to get ahead of Wednesday’s press briefing, printing a full page ad in The Washington Post as damage control for whatever Burr and Warner said about the company’s role in the election and its interactions with the committee.

            "93 Challenge to data transfer tool used by Facebook will go to Europe’s top court\n",
            "Facebook  has bought itself a little more time over a major legal challenge in Europe after the Irish High Court decided not to strike down a b2b mechanism it uses to transfer user data between its EU and U.S. businesses for processing. Rather the court said today that it will refer legal questions over so-called Standard Contractual Contracts (SCCs) to Europe’s top court, the ECJ, for a preliminary ruling. This means it could take around 1.5 years before there is a judgement, and Facebook can continue to use SCCs in the meanwhile instead of being forced to suspend these data transfers. The challenge to Facebook’s use of SCCs was brought by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems. He had originally complained to the Irish data protection commissioner (DPC), asking it to suspend data flows in Facebook’s case. But while the DPC agreed there are legal questions over the mechanism it decided to refer the issue to the High Court to consider the legality of SCCs as a whole. The five-week court hearing in what is a complex case delving into detail on US surveillance operations took place in February. The court issued its ruling today. The 153-page ruling starts by noting “this is an unusual case”, before going into a detailed discussion of the arguments and concluding that the DPC’s concerns about the validity of SCCs should be referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. Schrems is also the man responsible for bringing, in 2013, a legal challenge that ultimately struck down Safe Harbor — the legal mechanism that had oiled the pipe for EU-US personal data flows for fifteen years before the ECJ ruled it to be invalid in October 2015. Schrems’ argument had centered on U.S. government mass surveillance programs, as disclosed via the Snowden leaks, being incompatible with fundamental European privacy rights. After the ECJ struck down Safe Harbor he then sought to apply the same arguments against Facebook’s use of SCCs — returning to Ireland to make the complaint as that’s where the company has its European HQ. It’s worth noting that the European Commission has since replaced Safe Harbor with a new (and it claims more robust) data transfer mechanism, called the EU-US Privacy Shield — which is now, as Safe Harbor was, used by thousands of businesses. Although that too is facing legal challenges as critics continue to argue there is a core problem of incompatibility between two distinct legal regimes where EU privacy rights collide with US mass surveillance. Schrems’ Safe Harbor challenge also started in the Irish Court before being ultimately referred to the ECJ. So there’s more than a little legal deja vu here, especially given the latest development in the case. In its ruling on the SCC issue, the Irish Court noted that a US ombudsperson position created under Privacy Shield to handle EU citizens complaints about companies’ handling of their data is not enough to overcome what it described as “well founded concerns” raised by the DPC regarding the adequacy of the protections for EU citizens data. (Although, in a further irony, a permanent ombudsperson has yet to be appointed by the Trump administration.) Key conclusion from Irish High Court judgment referring to #CJEU @DPCIreland Facebook Schrems case on validity of #SCCs #EUDataP pic.twitter.com/LBGoQlHPRu — Data Protection Commissioner Ireland (@DPCIreland) October 3, 2017  The exact questions that will to be referred by the court to the CJEU will be decided at a later date this month. Making a video statement outside court in Dublin today, Schrems said the Irish court had dismissed Facebook’s argument that the US government does not undertake any surveillance. https://twitter.com/maxschrems/status/915168555745849344 In a written statement on the ruling Schrems added: “I welcome the judgement by the Irish High Court. It is important that a neutral Court outside of the US has summarized the facts on US surveillance in a judgement, after diving through more than 45,000 pages of documents in a five week hearing. “I am of the view the Standard Contractual Clauses are perfectly valid, as they would allow the DPC to do its job and suspend individual problematic data flows, such as Facebook’s. It is still unclear to me why the DPC is taking the extreme position that the SCCs should be invalidated Facebook across the board, when a targeted solution is available. The only explanation that I have is that they want to shift the responsibility back to Luxembourg instead of deciding themselves.” On Facebook, he also said: “In simple terms, US law requires Facebook to help the NSA with mass surveillance and EU law prohibits just that. As Facebook is subject to both jurisdictions, they got themselves in a legal dilemma that they cannot possibly solve in the long run.” We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment and will include the company’s response when we have it. Update: A company spokesperson has now provided the following statement via email: Standard Contract Clauses provide critical safeguards to ensure that Europeans’ data is protected once transferred to companies that operate in the US or elsewhere around the globe, and are used by thousands of companies to do business. They are essential to companies of all sizes, and upholding them is critical to ensuring the economy can continue to grow without disruption. This ruling will have no immediate impact on the people or businesses who use our services. However it is essential that the [ECJ] now considers the extensive evidence demonstrating the robust protections in place under Standard Contractual Clauses and US law, before it makes any decision that may endanger the transfer of data across the Atlantic and around the globe. While Schrems’ original complaint pertained to Facebook, the Irish DPC’s position means many more companies that use the mechanism could face disruption if SCCs are ultimately invalidated as a result of the legal challenge to their validity. Responding to today’s ruling, the BSA — one of the amicus curiae in the case speaking up for the importance of SCCs as “a basis for data transfers that are essential to the economy and job creation on both sides of the Atlantic” — said in a statement: “We have argued that this case should not be about standard contractual clauses in their entirety, but instead about how the clauses were formulated and used for the specific transfers involved here. We also explained that the SCCs include important safeguards to protect users — among them, they grant national data protection authorities the power to review specific implementation of these clauses on a case by case basis. We will continue to advocate these perspectives before the Court of Justice of the EU.” Europe’s influential Article 29 Working Party, which is made up of representatives from all the data protection authorities of the Member States, has previously voiced concerns about SCCs. It also has ongoing concerns about Privacy Shield. The latter mechanism underwent its first annual review by EU officials in the US last month — and a report is due this month. Although the EC, which drove the process to replace the defunct Safe Harbor, was quick to profess itself publicly satisfied with what it has seen. ⚡️ “Official Visit to Washington D.C and San Francisco”https://t.co/82LqHEYUbw — Věra Jourová (@VeraJourova) September 22, 2017   \n",

            "Facebook’s  data-conserving version of Messenger is no longer just for developing nations with slow networks. Now the Messenger Lite Android app is expanding to the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Ireland after previously being available in more than 100 mostly developing countries. Messenger Lite packs most of the critical features of the app, but skips things like Messenger Day and selfie lenses that can drain data. There’s still no plan for an iOS version, though. Previously, Messenger Lite was primarily for users in areas with weak bandwidth so the app would run faster. But now its expansion into Facebook’s top developed world markets makes it a tool for penny-pinching users like teenagers who want to avoid burning away their pricey megabytes but still stay in touch. “We’re excited to bring Messenger Lite to Android users in four new markets, including Canada, Ireland, the U.K. and the U.S.,” a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Messenger Lite is a slimmed-down version of Messenger that offers the core features of the app, while giving everyone the opportunity to stay connected to their friends and family, regardless of device or quality of internet connectivity.” Facebook first launched Messenger Lite in October 2016 in five countries before its near global expansion in April. Now Sensor Tower estimates Messenger Lite has been download 47 million times since launch, led by India and Brazil. The new rollout could help Facebook attract more teens to Messenger, both traditional and Lite. That’s because if downloading Lite makes them respond to more messages more quickly, it thereby encourages friends to stick with Messenger instead of defaulting back to SMS or iMessage, or straying to Snapchat. Messenger Lite The developing world has proven a challenge for Snapchat. Its video-heavy app doesn’t perform well in low-bandwidth conditions. And where there are friends who can’t use an app, people end up switching to one they can access. For Messenger to keep expanding beyond its existing 1.3 billion users, it needs to do everything it can to be maximally accessible. Though it may be harder to monetize Messenger Lite users, it’s worth it for Facebook as chat is the center of the mobile use case. If it can keep people on Messenger, it’s more likely to retain them in the rest of its family of apps.  \n",

            "95 Facebook will hire 1,000 and make ads visible to fight election interference\n",
            "Facebook  today handed over to congressional investigators 3,000 ads that were bought by a Russian company to influence U.S. politics. “Many appear to exploit racial and social divisions and exploit ugly stereotypes. We find this interference deeply offensive,” a Facebook spokesperson wrote this morning. Facebook says that an estimated 10 million people saw the ads, with 44% of the ads seen before the US election, and 56% after, while 25% of the ads were never shown to anyone. 50% of the ads got less than $3 in ad spend, and 99% got less than $1,000. The ads largely focused on polarizing issues including LGBT treatment, race, gun rights, and immigration. Some were purchased with Russian currency, though legitimate ads often are so that didn’t mean Facebook should have automatically rejected them. Facebook also announced specifics of how it will implement changes to its advertising systems in order to thwart abuse and, specifically, election interference, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised last week. He later asked for forgiveness for how his products have been used to divide people. Facebook briefed TechCrunch on the changes that include hiring 1,000 more people to its global ads review team over the next year, and making it so anyone can see any ad run by any organization on Facebook instead of only the ads targeted to them. The changes should boost the integrity of Facebook’s ad systems and prevent some of the abuse that plagued the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Facebook told TechCrunch last night that it planned to share the 3,000 ads with the congressional investigators this morning. As we wrote then: Facebook’s disclosure to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee will include information on the ads’ content and targeting as well as the accounts that paid approximately $100,000 for them to run between 2015 and 2017 in the U.S. It previously announced these ads were tied to 470 accounts and Pages “associated with a Russian entity known as the Internet Research Agency.” Facebook believes that congressional investigators for the three committees are best placed to review the ads and make determinations on them based on their access to classified intelligence and information from all relevant companies and industries, beyond Facebook own internal investigation, according to a spokesperson. Facebook does not plan to release the ad data publicly. Facebook now writes that “This manipulation runs counter to Facebook’s mission of building community and everything we stand for. It is especially distressing that people tried to use our products to maliciously influence our election and divide us as a country.” The ads have all been taken down, though the damage is done. But at least next time it will more difficult, thanks to five new changes Facebook is making. Here are the changes, with our analysis of their potential impact: 1. Making advertising more transparent “We believe that when you see an ad, you should know who ran it and what other ads they’re running — which is why we show you the Page name for any ads that run in your feed. To provide even greater transparency for people and accountability for advertisers, we’re now building new tools that will allow you to see the other ads a Page is running as well — including ads that aren’t targeted to you directly. We hope that this will establish a new standard for our industry in ad transparency. We try to catch content that shouldn’t be on Facebook before it’s even posted — but because this is not always possible, we also take action when people report ads that violate our policies. We’re grateful to our community for this support, and hope that more transparency will mean more people can report inappropriate ads.” Analysis: Facebook’s “dark posts,” aka ads that aren’t publicly visible, made it impossible to know what exactly advertisers were saying. The tool to view all variants may be clumsy, but will force advertisers to avoid controversial or abusive content and be accountable. However, it may deter innocent experimentation in advertising since poorly made ads could embarrass their buyer. Ad watchdogs will soon be able to aggressively monitor questionable advertisers. 2. Strengthening enforcement against improper ads “We use both automated and manual review, and we’re taking aggressive steps to strengthen both. Reviewing ads means assessing not just the content of an ad, but the context in which it was bought and the intended audience — so we’re changing our ads review system to pay more attention to these signals. We’re also adding more than 1,000 people to our global ads review teams over the next year, and investing more in machine learning to better understand when to flag and take down ads. Enforcement is never perfect, but we will get better at finding and removing improper ads.” Analysis: Facebook is wise to admit it can’t catch every abuse. At least now it will put more of its $3 billion+ in quarterly profit toward reducing the problem. It’s the least such a money-printing company could do. The new algorithmic review systems will have to be closely managed, though, to avoid accidentally censoring legitimate ads.  3. Tightening restrictions on advertiser content “We hold people on Facebook to our Community Standards, and we hold advertisers to even stricter guidelines. Our ads policies already prohibit shocking content, direct threats, and the promotion of the sale or use of weapons. Going forward, we are expanding these policies to prevent ads that use even more subtle expressions of violence.” Analysis: Explicitly forbidding more subtle abuse will give Facebook rules it can point to during enforcement. But the bigger challenge than writing rules is consistently and fairly enforcing them. That’s especially tricky since Facebook hasn’t detailed what constitutes “subtle expressions of violence,” though we’ve asked for more info. 4. Increasing requirements for authenticity “We’re updating our policies to require more thorough documentation from advertisers who want to run US federal election-related ads. Potential advertisers will have to confirm the business or organization they represent before they can buy ads. As Mark said, we won’t catch everyone immediately, but we can make it harder to try to interfere.” Analysis: Facebook will hopefully expand this documentation policy to encompass more countries with elections targeted by trolls and foreign governments. This is something Facebook could have implemented before the U.S. election had it taken the threat more seriously, and shows how it must improve to be proactive instead of reactive with its protections. 5. Establishing industry standards and best practices “In order to fight threats like these, we’re all going to need to work together. We are reaching out to leaders in our industry and governments around the world to share information on bad actors and make sure they stay off all platforms.” Analysis: Twitter has already admitted it too was used by Russian election interferers. Now beyond spam, security, terrorism and child pornography, Facebook will collaborate with fellow companies including Twitter and Google as well as governments to create cross-web databases of known malicious accounts, ads and the strategies trolls use to avoid detection. That could allow one intrusion to lead other platforms to be inoculated.

Mikhail Metzel/TASS (Photo by Mikhail MetzelTASS via Getty Images) Because these Russian-bought ads were purchased fraudulently, Facebook took them down regardless of their content. But Facebook’s VP of policy Elliot Schrage admits that “We are dedicated to being an open platform for all ideas — and that may sometimes mean allowing people to express views we — or others — find objectionable. This has been the longstanding challenge for all democracies: how to foster honest and authentic political speech while protecting civic discourse from manipulation and abuse.” As long as ads or content don’t express hate or violence, they can still rattle the public and embarass Facebook. It’s allegiance to even objectionable free speech shifts Facebook further away from being a media company and more towards a technology platform…or a digital nation-state of its own. Upholding this perspective will test its resolve in the face of criticism. And trolls are sure to bait it into censorship by tip-toeing the line between disgraceful and deletable. Facebook has again shown it can adequately react to problems, and hopefully its past failures will push it to anticipate future worst-case scenarios. Schrage concludes, “Now that the challenge has taken a new shape, it will be up to all of us to meet it.”  \n",

            "96 Facebook will share Russian-bought election interference ads with Congress tomorrow\n",
            "Facebook  will release over 3,000 ads bought by a Russian entity to interfere in U.S. politics and the 2016 presidential election with congressional investigators tomorrow morning at 8am Pacific, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. Facebook’s disclosure to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee will include information on the ads’ content and targeting, as well as the accounts that paid approximately $100,000 for them to run between 2015 and 2017 in the U.S. It previously announced these ads were tied to 470 accounts and Pages “associated with a Russian entity known as the Internet Research Agency.” Facebook believes that congressional investigators for the three comittees are best placed to review the ads and make determinations on them based on their access to classified intelligence and information from all relevant companies and industries, beyond Facebook own internal investigation, according to a spokesperson. Facebook does not plan to release the ad data publicly. Congressional investigators could combine Facebook’s data with that which Twitter has pledged to provide. This includes data on 201 accounts suspected of having engaged in misinformation campaigns on Twitter, and $274,100 in spend on U.S. ads in 2016 by Russian government-linked news outlet Russia.  Google, Facebook, and Twitter have been invited to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee on November 1st about the Russian probe. However, Senator Mark Warner said Twitter’s initial briefing to the Senate Intelligence Committee was “inadequate”. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed Facebook had received the invitation but didn’t have more to share on whether Facebook will in fact testify. Facebook already shared this information with special counsel Robert Mueller around September 15th the Wall Street Journal first reported, likely because it received a search warrant, but initially withheld them from congress to avoid violating federal privacy laws or disrupting the Mueller probe. On September 21st Facebook announced that it planned to share these ads with congress, and is now confirming that tomorrow morning will be when that happens. Facebook also plans a long list of changes to its political ad buying systems which could be seen a sufficient self-regulation to deter the need for official government regulation. Facebook says the goal is to provide the relevant information necessary for congressional investigators to understand and contextualize the ads. These ads are believed to have been a purposeful attempt by Russian operatives to influence the U.S. presidential election. A falsified CNN screenshot depicting a fictitious ISIS attack on the Columbian Chemicals Company in 2014 that was tied to the Internet Research Agency The Internet Research Agency has been described by the New York Times as “an army of well-paid ‘trolls'” based in St. Petersburg, Russia that have tried to spread misinformation through coordinated Internet campaigns to interfere with U.S. foreign policy and boost Russian president Vladimir Putin. The company was tied to the 2014 #ColumbianChemicals hoax where trolls used a falsified CNN screenshot, YouTube video, and Wikipedia page to convince people that a fictional chemical processing plant in Louisiana had been blown up by ISIS, with accounts urging the US to bomb Iraq in response. Russian newspapers had at one point reported that the Internet Research Agency had 400 employees and a $400,000 per month budget. They had also written that the Internet Research Agency is funded by Evgeny Prigozhin, a restaurant owner and oligarch with big Russian government contracts and close ties to Putin. The investigation of Facebook’s data could strengthen the known connections between the Internet Research Agency, political misinformation campaigns, and the Kremlin. Two weeks ago Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a 9-point plan to curb election interference, help people and investigators understand what happened, increase ad transparency, and improve election integrity. Tomorrow we may learn more about how Facebook will implement those plans, which are: The first plan will be fulfilled tomorrow. The last plan was carried out successfully in an election that saw German chancellor Angela Merkel secure a fourth term, but with reduced authority as radical right-wing party AfD joined parliament as the third-largest party. Facebook took actions including deleting tens of thousands of suspicious account, fighting fake news in clickbait, providing ways for politicians to share their stances, and working with the German election commission. Facebook’s VP of Public Policy for EMEA Richard Allan wrote that “These actions did not eliminate misinformation entirely in this election – but they did make it harder to spread, and less likely to appear in people’s News Feeds.” Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Facebook’s forthcoming changes could further reduce the potential for misuse of its platform to sway elections, and provide tactical assistance to other tech giants trying to do the same. Facebook may need to make it harder for organizations to buy election ads, which could reduce the revenue it receives from this business. But that’s a small price it seems willing to pay in order to prevent the voice it gives everyone being misappropriated to spread lies and propaganda. I’ve called on Facebook to more proactively anticipate the worst-case scenarios for how its platform can be employed, rather than assuming people will utilize it only in good faith or that problems are just low-scale edge cases. With enough technology, human moderation, and cooperation with governments and peers, it could put the safeguards in place to steeply reduce the chances that this foul play ever reaches the News Feed again.  \n",

            "Facebook  has its own version of Apple’s Face ID. If you get locked out of your Facebook account, the company is testing a way to regain access by using your face to verify your identity. That could be especially useful if you’re somewhere that you can’t receive two-factor authentication SMS, like on a plane or while traveling abroad, or if you lose access to your email account. Social media researcher Devesh Logendran (a pseudonym) sent a screenshot of the feature to TNW’s Matt Navarra. We asked Facebook about it and got this confirmation: “We are testing a new feature for people who want to quickly and easily verify account ownership during the account recovery process. This optional feature is available only on devices you’ve already used to log in. It is another step, alongside two-factor authentication via SMS, that were taking to make sure account owners can confirm their identity.” If the feature proves reliably helpful to users and isn’t fooled by hackers, Facebook could potentially roll it out to more people. Over the years Facebook has tried a number of novel ways to help you get back into a locked account. In some cases it asks you to identify photos of your friends to prove you’re you. Or it’s tried allowing you to designate several “trusted friends” who receive a code that you can ask them for to unlock your account. While Facebook has experienced some backlash to facial recognition for photo tag suggestions in the past, this feature would only use the technology to privately help you out. Therefore it shouldn’t engender as big of privacy concerns, though obviously anything related to biometric data can give people pause. But if it means you can get back to your messages and News Feed, or repair damage done by a hacker, many people are likely to be comfortable to use their face to Facebook.  \n",

            "Facebook has made no secret of its wish to do more in the online recruitment market — encroaching on territory today dominated by LinkedIn, the leader in tapping social networking graphs to boost job-hunting. Today, Facebook  is taking the next step in that process. Facebook will now integrate with ZipRecruiter — an aggregator that allows those looking to fill jobs to post ads to many traditional job boards, as well as sites like LinkedIn, Google and Twitter — to boost the number of job ads available on its platform targeting its 2 billion monthly active users. The move follows Facebook launching its first job ads earlier this year, and later appearing to be interested in augmenting that with more career-focused features, such as a platform to connect people looking for mentors with those looking to offer mentorship. Today’s expansion is another development on that track. Before now, companies that wanted to use Facebook for recruiting, adding job ads to their Pages, would have had to do this directly through Facebook itself. By partnering with ZipRecruiter  and others like it, organizations will now be able to tick a box to broadcast the job add to Facebook among a wider mix of job boards that can be accessed through a one-stop shop — ZipRecruiter, as one example, covers hundreds of these boards. Facebook’s PM for Jobs, Gaurav Dosi, is expected to make an announcement about the new integration this morning at a conference for the talent/recruitment industry. The move is interesting because it’s a sign not just of how Facebook is looking for more volume and usage of its jobs feature, but also the realization that it may not be able to achieve this on its own steam, leading to a more friction-free, user-friendly approach. “40% of US small businesses report that filling jobs was more difficult than they expected, which is challenging when you consider that these small businesses also employ nearly half of the country’s workforce,”Dosi said in a statement provided to us by Facebook. “Facebook’s goal is to take the work out of finding a local job and hiring the right people. This partnership with ZipRecruiter is another way we’re making the process even easier for people and businesses alike.” The company declined to comment about more details of the deal, but from what we understand while ZipRecruiter is the lead partner, it is not an exclusive deal and Facebook with also work with others. The other point that this deal underscores is just how fragmented the whole industry of recruitment remains today.  “In the U.S. there are over 40,000 job sites, and some historical blue-chip companies in the recruitment space, all fighting for attention,” said ZipRecruiter’s co-founder and CEO Ian Siegel, “so for Facebook to come in and be another job site… well, there is more than one way to do that.” He added, though, that the opportunity is huge for Facebook if handled well. Social platforms generally have very strong performance when it comes to job ads — in part because employees can tap their networks and so inbound interest tends to be less random. “They deliver good quality candidates,” Siegel said. “People who come through the network of current employees can be vouched for.” At the same time, there is less jobs noise: “People are interacting on a wide variety of subjects, not just jobs, so it feels very organic.” And he said that a number of companies that post ads through ZipRecruiter had been requesting Facebook integration. Both he and Facebook would not comment on who approached whom for this integration. ZipRecruiter has raised $63 million in a single round of funding in 2014, and Siegel would not comment on whether it plans to raise more.  \n",

            "Tech companies — and the nation — have been slow to mobilize in response to the devastation wrought by last week’s catastrophic Hurricane Maria that decimated Puerto Rico, but today Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company’s response. With 90 percent of the island territory’s cell towers out of service, people on the island are finding it impossible to communicate with loved ones on the mainland in the U.S., and rescue workers can’t coordinate their relief efforts. Zuckerberg said his company is sending the Facebook  connectivity team to deliver emergency telecommunications assistance to the storm-ravaged island nation. The company also will donate $1.5 million to NetHope and the World Food Programme, and is committing Facebook ad space to disseminate information to people in the region on how to get assistance and stay safe, Zuckerberg wrote. The text of Zuck’s post is below: I’ve been following the news from Puerto Rico where millions of Americans still don’t have food, water, fuel and electricity after Hurricane Maria. Communication is critical during a disaster. With 90% of cell towers on the island out of service, people can’t get in touch with their loved ones — and it’s harder for rescue workers to coordinate relief efforts. We’re working to get Puerto Rico back online. We’re sending the Facebook connectivity team to deliver emergency telecommunications assistance to get the systems up and running. We’re also supporting this work with a $1.5 million donation to NetHope and the World Food Programme. We’re also donating Facebook ads to get critical information to people in the region on how to get assistance and stay safe. I’m thinking of everyone in Puerto Rico and the many other communities that have been affected by recent hurricanes. One way you can help is by donating to Save the Children to support the recovery and relief efforts. This story is developing and we’ll update it with responses from other tech companies as we get them.  \n",

            "Facebook  may have dropped the ball with the U.S. presidential election, but it was much better prepared for last weekend’s federal election in Germany. Today, Facebook outlined all its efforts to prevent malicious actors from meddling in the election. “These actions did not eliminate misinformation entirely in this election – but they did make it harder to spread, and less likely to appear in people’s News Feeds,” wrote Richard Allan, Facebook’s VP of Public Policy for EMEA. That includes: Facebook shows alternative sources in Related Articles to give readers more perspective on potentially fake news A study found that fake news prevalence surrounding the election was low, indicating some level of success for Facebook. If Facebook can use this same set of strategies as well as develop new ones, it may be able to significantly reduce the potential for misuse of its platform to sway elections. From there, it can work on actually mending the rifts in our societies caused by political polarization. Facebook may find resistance from Trump if it tries to implement more of these tactics stateside. Today Trump tweeted that Facebook is “anti-Trump,” which we suspect may cause Facebook to investigate election interference on his behalf less aggressively to avoid seeming biased. While it’s too late to undue damage caused by election interference that may have helped Donald Trump get elected, the efforts in Germany show Facebook is willing to admit its shortcomings, learn fast and make progress.  \n",

            "Starting October 1, passengers on most Delta will have free access to WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and iMessage. To access the feature, a passenger will have to log into Delta’s in-flight wifi portal powered by Gogo. This is first time an airline has offered such a service throughout its fleet.

Passengers are, thankfully, not able to use this service to live stream from their flight. I fly a lot and this is a significant free service to me. Over countless flights, I purchased a costly Gogo internet package just to use iMessage. Most of the time in a flight I don’t want to check my email or Slack or Twitter. When flying I want some me time, but sometimes, it’s also nice to just chat with some friends and now that can be done for free.

            "Workplace — Facebook’s bid to take on the Slack, Microsoft and the rest of the players in the market of business chat and collaboration — is getting a big push today by way of a significant customer win. The company has signed on Walmart, the retailing giant and the world’s biggest employer with 2.2 million employees on its books. Walmart  is rolling out Workplace to the whole of its business in stages, starting with associates and teams at Sam’s Club and other parts of the operation. The move speaks to how Walmart — which last year acquired Jet.com for $3 billion — continues to step up its tech game as it feels the pinch of competition from Amazon, an e-commerce giant that is very quickly moving into Walmart’s brick-and-mortar territory. “We believe the right technology can empower our people. Walmart’s vision of the future is centered around people — by serving the communities people live in and the people who work at Walmart,” said Clay Johnson, Walmart’s CIO and EVP. “Workplace shares this mission, and together we’re building the next generation workforce.” Some of the uses so far for Walmart include to share pictures with other stores of a particular product display; to broadcast news via the Live video stream; and to manage communications between different geographies using Facebook’s  automatic translation features (Walmart has operations across North America, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia). For Facebook, the new customer comes at a time of steady growth for Workplace, an enterprise version of the social network designed specifically for use by teams and entire businesses. Workplace emerged from a closed beta about a year ago and has picked up some 14,000 businesses since. Julien Codorniou, VP of Workplace, told TechCrunch that Facebook is not revealing what that translates to as a total number of users. Other customers include the likes of Starbucks (total employees: 254,000) and Telenor (37,000), although it’s not clear how many employees at these companies are actively using Workplace. There are a lot of areas in enterprise software dominated by legacy players that are ripe for disruption by other companies using tech to do things differently and more efficiently (indeed, it’s a paradigm that Amazon is chasing very aggressively with its AWS division). But by virtue of being a relatively new concept, the same does not go for social networking in the enterprise world, yet. In the case of Workplace, it’s competing for customers against the likes of Slack (which itself launched an enterprise tier earlier this year), Teams and Yammer (with the latter two from Microsoft), Chatter from Salesforce, Jive, and a slew of similar services of varying popularity, with new services launching seemingly every day (today’s launch: Cliq from Zoho). Indeed, there is no single company dominating the market, with many players only emerging in the last five or so years. That means the field is wide open for a land grab, but also that there is still a lot of movement among customers. Walmart, for example, also seems to be a customer of Slack’s. Its Walmart Labs division once was Slack’s largest customer, and as of my most recent sign-in attempts today — using two domains that I found on Reddit from people chatting about official Walmart Slack channels — there still seem to be Walmart accounts integrated with the platform. (And do not forget that Jet.com seems to credit Slack for helping it clinch its Walmart deal. It may not part ways so soon.) Walmart would not comment on Slack directly. “We use a variety of tools within the technology landscape,” said Dan Kneeshaw, a senior director of digital strategy and brand engagement at Walmart, in an interview. “We brought Workplace in to complement other tools that are being used.” From what I understand, Walmart is still looking at the optimal way of distributing Workplace most widely. For now, both employees who are not using Walmart-issued devices, as well as those who are, are being given the option of using the Workplace app on their own devices, and using the app itself is not mandated. Facebook and Walmart hope that there will be enough carrots to drive usage regardless. The interface of Workplace closely follows that of Facebook, which has been one of the key selling points for the service. For companies that have failed to get their employees to adopt and use other services, the pitch goes something like this: many people already use Facebook, so there is no learning curve with Workplace. That might resonate especially with companies with a lot of employees who are not tied to desks and are not “knowledge workers” using a variety of other software all day long. But in order to stay competitive with the likes of Slack — which has made a name for itself as an “operating system” by virtue of its hundreds of integrations and bots that let you interact with all the software your business uses — Facebook has also been expanding in Workplace’s functionality in more traditional IT ways. It now offers integrations with larger software platforms from Box, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft and Google. Earlier this year it also introduced enterprise compliance features, and in its wider bid to tap into tech being built for Facebook’s consumer products, it also introduced bots. “We know what we do well, and what we don’t want to do,” Codorniou said. “Workplace is the communication layer, and we want to make sure that it’s integrated well with the other things businesses use.” The service, subsequently, comes in a freemium plan. There is a basic, tariff-free tier that gives users features that are very similar to what you get on Facebook today, minus the ads: it includes communication tools like voice and video; single and group chat functionality; and unlimited photo storage. The premium tiers, meanwhile, include all the integration features, admin controls, admin support, APIs and single sign-on, active directory support. They start at $3 per user for the first 1,000 active users; $2 for the next 9,000; and $1 for all above that. The premium service is free for non-profits and educational institutions.  \n",

            "103 The NFL partners with Facebook to distribute game highlights and recaps on the social network\n",
            "Facebook  and the NFL this morning announced a new multi-year programming deal that will see the sports organization distributing official NFL video, including game recaps and official highlights, to the social network. According to the NFL, the videos and recaps will be from all 256 regular season games, plus the playoffs and the Super Bowl, and will be made available to Facebook users worldwide. Alongside the footage from the games themselves, the NFL’s media division will also distribute content from its production arm NFL Films on Facebook’s newly launched Watch platform. Here, users in the U.S. will be able to watch “NFL Turning Point,” “Sound FX” and “NFL Game Recaps” every week. However, that limitation is due to Facebook Watch being a U.S.-only feature at this time. International users will be able to view the same programming on the Show pages on Facebook, and can view the highlights by following the NFL or any of its 32 Clubs on Facebook, says the NFL. “We have millions of fans on Facebook, and they continue to demonstrate an incredible appetite for NFL content,” said Hans Schroeder, Chief Operating Officer of NFL Media, in a statement. “We’re excited to bring a compelling set of highlights and shows from the NFL and our Clubs to our fans on Facebook.” The deal comes at a time when the NFL has been expanding its reach across social media. Last season, the NFL had a $10 million deal with Twitter to live stream Thursday Night Football, for example. But Twitter lost the deal to Amazon this year which paid $50 million for the games that are being made available for free to Amazon Prime members. Twitter instead this year did a deal with the NFL for a new, 30-minute live streamed show called #NFLBlitz and other live sports programming, like breaking news, highlights, fantasy projections, pre-game updates, key storylines, team power rankings, and more. This is not Facebook’s first deal to bring streaming sports to its social network. In May, the company announced plans to live stream Major League Soccer matches; in June, it said it would live stream Champions League Soccer via a deal with Fox; and in August, it partnered with sports network Stadium to stream live college football games. While Facebook’s NFL agreement won’t deliver live games to fans, it is indicative of the importance of sports programming in general to boosting video views and drawing in new users to Facebook’s Watch video platform. Sports is a key category in Facebook Watch, which launched with a number of programs in this area, including Golden State Warriors’ “Championship Rewind,” Univision Deportes’ “Liga MX” (live LigaMX soccer matches), and NBA’s “WNBA All-Access,” in addition to the MLB games and a live show called “12:25 Live.”  \n",

            "104 Facebook drops no-vote stock plan, Zuck will sell shares to fund philanthropy\n",
            "Mark Zuckerberg  has gotten so rich that he can fund his philanthropic foundation and retain voting control without Facebook  having to issue a proposed non-voting class of stock that faced shareholder resistance. Today Facebook announced that it’s withdrawn its plan to issue Class C no-vote stock and has resolved the shareholder lawsuit seeking to block the corporate governance overhaul. Instead, Zuckerberg says that because Facebook has become so valuable, he can sell a smaller allotment of his stake in the company to deliver plenty of capital to his Chan Zuckerberg Initiative foundation that aims to help eradicate disease and deliver personalized education to all children. “Over the past year and a half, Facebook’s business has performed well and the value of our stock has grown to the point that I can fully fund our philanthropy and retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more,” Zuckerberg writes. Facebook’s share price has increased roughly 45 percent, from $117 to $170, since the Class C stock plan was announced, with Facebook now valued at $495 billion. Mark Zuckerberg, Priscilla Chan and their daughters Max and August “We are gratified that Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg have agreed not to proceed with the reclassification we were challenging,” writes Lee Rudy, the partner at Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check LLP that was representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit seeking to block the no-vote share creation. Zuckerberg was slated to testify in the suit later this month, but now won’t have to. “This result is a full victory for Facebook’s stockholders, and achieved everything we could have hoped to obtain by winning a permanent injunction at trial.” “I want to be clear: this doesn’t change Priscilla and my plans to give away 99% of our Facebook shares during our lives. In fact, we now plan to accelerate our work and sell more of those shares sooner,” Zuckerberg wrote. “I anticipate selling 35-75 million Facebook shares in the next 18 months to fund our work in education, science, and advocacy.” That equates to $5.95 billion to $12.75 billion worth of Facebook shares Zuckerberg will liquidate. When Zuckerberg announced the plan in April 2016, he wrote that being a founder-led company where he controls enough votes to always steer Facebook’s direction rather than cowing to public shareholders lets Facebook “resist the short term pressures that often hurt companies.” By issuing the non-voting shares, “I’ll be able to keep founder control of Facebook so we can continue to build for the long term, and Priscilla and I will be able to give our money to fund important work sooner.” A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative told TechCrunch that this outcome is very good for the foundation, because it provides more predictability to its funding. The plan will also allow Zuckerberg to deliver cash to the CZI sooner, which its new CFO Peggy Alford will be able to allocate between its health, education and advocacy projects. With the new plan to sell shares, it’s unclear what might happen to Zuckerberg’s iron grip on Facebook’s future in “20 years or more.” Dropping the Class C shares plan may be seen as a blow to Facebook board member Marc Andreessen, who Bloomberg revealed had coached Zuckerberg through pushing the proposed plan through the rest of the board. But given Zuckerberg’s power, Andreessen is unlikely to be ousted unless the Facebook CEO wants him gone. Zuckerberg strolls through the developer conference of Oculus, the VR company he pushed Facebook to acquire For the foreseeable future, though, Zuckerberg will have the power to shape Facebook’s decisions. His business instincts have proven wise over the years. Acquisitions he orchestrated that seemed pricey at first — like Instagram and WhatsApp — have been validated as their apps grow to multiples of their pre-buy size. And Zuckerberg’s relentless prioritization of the user experience over that of advertisers and outside developers has kept the Facebook community deeply engaged instead of pushed away with spam. Zuckerberg’s ability to maintain power could allow him to continue to make bold or counter-intuitive decisions without shareholder interference. But the concentration of power also puts Facebook in a precarious position if Zuckerberg were to be tarnished by scandal or suddenly unable to continue his duties as CEO. Zuckerberg warned investors when Facebook went public that “Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission.” And yet Facebook has flourished into one of the world’s most successful businesses in part because shareholders weren’t allowed to sell its ambitions short.  \n",

            "As Congressional investigations into Russia’s role in manipulating the election for U.S. president deepens, tech companies are assuming a more central role in the inquiries. Both Twitter  and Facebook  are stepping up their efforts to cooperate with Congressional investigations into Russian interference with last year’s presidential election. For Twitter, that means agreeing to a briefing with the Senate Intelligence Committee chaired by Virginia Democrat Mark Warner next Wednesday on the role foreign agents operating on the company’s social network may have played in influencing the election. Meanwhile, Facebook has agreed to release the 3,000 ads it had identified as having been purchased by accounts associated with a Russian organization called the Internet Research Agency (and which might have played a role in shaping results of the election). The moves are significant for several reasons. They underscore not just the central role these social media sites have played in political events, but also they highlight how that role may have been in part a negative and illegal one, rather than the exclusively positive and educative one that the sites would have you think. The moves also highlight the tensions that continue to exist — and will not soon disappear — between data privacy and proprietary platforms, and producing information when mandated by authorities and to what end those are justifiable requests. In a statement posted to Facebook’s site, company general counsel, Colin Stretch, announced the reversal of the company’s initial decision not to share the ads. Stretch writes: After an extensive legal and policy review, today we are announcing that we will also share these ads with congressional investigators. We believe it is vitally important that government authorities have the information they need to deliver to the public a full assessment of what happened in the 2016 election. That is an assessment that can be made only by investigators with access to classified intelligence and information from all relevant companies and industries — and we want to do our part. Congress is best placed to use the information we and others provide to inform the public comprehensively and completely. The Facebook general counsel said that it was not a decision the company took lightly, in part because the company considers ads user content. Setting aside anything that might be problematic with that approach, Facebook also made the argument that the initial decision to withhold the ads was done so the company wouldn’t set a troubling precedent for future information requests from any government. That logic also begins to look specious in light of the company’s reported approach to restricting and monitoring content in other nations with more authoritarian governments. But here, again, are Stretch’s comments: As our biannual transparency reports make clear, we carefully scrutinize all government data requests, from here and abroad, and we push back where they do not adhere to those legal limitations. And, of course, we also recognize and support the important work of government investigations and take care not to take steps, like public disclosures, that might undermine them. What ultimately swayed the company’s mind (officially) was the fact that the investigation goes to the integrity of the nation’ selection process… and that the tools used were so sophisticated that “understanding those efforts requires a united effort, from across the technology, intelligence and political communities.” At Twitter, meanwhile, executives from its Washington, DC office will appear before the Senate committee investigating Russian interference in the election. “Twitter engages with governments around the world on public policy issues of importance and of interest to policymakers. We are cooperating with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in its inquiry into the 2016 election and will meet with committee staff next week,” a spokesperson for the company wrote in an email. “Twitter deeply respects the integrity of the election process, a cornerstone of all democracies, and will continue to strengthen our platform against bots and other forms of manipulation that violate our Terms of Service.” It has been reported that Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading an investigation into the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump’s associates, is also interested in probing Twitter as part of that investigation, but for now the social media site has yet to testify or provide documents. There had been reports that Twitter would appear before Warner’s committee, and Warner had stated his desire for the company to do so, but this is the first time that Twitter has confirmed its involvement directly.  \n",

            "According to its chairman, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence intends to call Facebook  to a public hearing on Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. North Carolina Senator Richard Burr made remarks to reporters on Tuesday confirming the committee’s interest in speaking with Facebook, the Hill reports. “We’re in agreement on a Facebook public hearing,” Burr said. “It’s just a question of when and potentially the scope.” Facebook has also reportedly cooperated with Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia and the Trump administration, handing over detailed information on political ads that were bought on its platform by entities with suspected links to the Russian government. So far, the company has refused to share these ads to the public in spite of calls for it to do so in the name of transparency. Mueller’s investigation and the Senate probe into Russia and the 2016 election are operating concurrently. The committee isn’t just interested in Facebook. Its ranking Democrat, Virginia Senator Mark Warner, confirmed that Twitter is also expected to appear before the group in a private briefing some time soon.  \n",

            "107 You can now launch the Instagram app directly from Facebook\n",
            "Facebook  is making it easier for users to access their Instagram  profile directly from within the Facebook app. The company confirms it’s rolling out a new addition its main navigation menu on mobile that includes a link to your Instagram account. This option appears just below the link to your personal profile in Facebook’s app, and above the links to any Facebook Pages you may manage. If you click the link, the Instagram app on your phone will then launch, taking you to Instagram’s main feed, just as it would if you had launched the app from your homescreen. The change, while minor, is notable because it allows Facebook to circulate users through its own mobile properties without potentially losing them to other mobile applications, like Twitter or Snapchat, for example. (Of course, this would work better if Instagram, in turn, would add a link back to Facebook, too. But at this point, we’re not seeing a similar option appear in Instagram.) “We’re looking at ways to help people stay in touch with their friends on Facebook and Instagram,” a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch, when confirming the new feature. “People on Facebook will be able to see how many of their friends are on Instagram,” they added.  This isn’t the first time Facebook has experimented with merging its properties. In May, the company was spotted testing a feature that showed the notification counters from the other apps and allowed you to instantly switch between them. These pop-over cross-app switchers were appearing for some users when they tapped the profile icon in the top corners of Facebook, Messenger or Instagram. Facebook briefly toyed with linking to other social networks, too. Comparatively, the new feature to add an Instagram link to users’ profiles is a much more conservative change. However, the move could further solidify Facebook’s position as one of the top mobile app makers, in terms of app installs and usage. Worldwide data from App Annie points to Facebook’s dominance today. Its app is the #1 app by all-time downloads, and Instagram is #4. Facebook and Instagram were also the #3 and #4 top apps by worldwide downloads, respectively, from January to August 2017.  Plus, according to data from comScore released in August, Facebook and Instagram both rank among the top 10 apps in terms of mobile penetration in the U.S., and Facebook itself is the number one app by monthly visitors. But when you start to break that down by demographic groups, Snapchat was found to rank higher than Instagram in terms of visitors aged 18 to 24. This backs up another recent study from eMarketer, which also found that teens favor Snapchat over Instagram and Facebook. Given Instagram’s fierce battle with Snapchat (which it is winning in terms of total usage), it makes sense that the company would now attempt to leverage Facebook in hopes of increasing Instagram’s visitor count, particularly from this young demographic, by way of this change. It’s unclear if the new feature has rolled out to all Facebook users at this time, but if you’re not an Instagram user, then nothing on your profile will have changed, we found.  \n",

            "You might think you’re impervious to Facebook’s  ads, but you probably do get seduced every once in a while. But because ads aren’t always permanently available anywhere, it can be impossible to find a Facebook ad that led somewhere you want to revisit. Now Facebook has a solution called Recent Ad Activity for when (if) you click an ad and want to see it again. TechCrunch inquired with Facebook about the feature after Matt Navarra shared a screenshot, and now the company admits that Recent Ad Activity has been fully rolled out in the US. Facebook tells us it’s considering what other countries to test the feature in. You can find Recent Ad Activity in the bookmarks sidebar of Facebook’s mobile apps and desktop site. Recent Ad Activity appears to show the past three months or so of ads you clicked, liked, commented on or shared. There’s also a tab for ads you purposefully saved. Unfortunately, the three-month window means no one will be able to dredge up the political ads bought by Russian agents seeking to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. Facebook has repeatedly refused to disclose the content of these ads publicly, citing that ads and their targeting are proprietary business secrets of its customers. It’s also bound by U.S. privacy laws that could penalize it for these disclosures. But with a search warrant, Facebook has given information about these ads’ content, targeting and buyers to Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the election, according to The Wall Street Journal and CNN.  The feature could be a boon to Facebook advertisers that seek to be remembered. Recent Ad Activity could let people click through an old ad and make a purchase or take another action the business cares about. That in turn could help Facebook take credit for driving purchases. If you saw an ad six weeks ago but can’t quite remember it, you might Google any details you recall, leading the search engine to take credit for delivering the conversion. With Recent Ad Activity, those users might just come back to Facebook, click through the ad again and give Facebook data it can use to convince advertisers to spend more.  \n",

            "In the ever-moving musical chairs that is the tech industry, Twitter  has added a new person to its product team. Sriram Krishnan is now senior director of product at the social media platform. He announced the news himself, appropriately on Twitter, with a hearty endorsement from CEO Jack Dorsey. He will be reporting to Keith Coleman, who is Twitter’s new-ish VP of Product (he joined in December). You may know Sriram from Tech Twitter — he’s a regular fixture there, pontificating, debating and snarking in 140 characters or less. But he’s also had an interesting career across some of the biggest names in the Valley, most recently at Snap, and before that at Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft (in order of most recent employers), in areas like product and advertising. It’s unclear what he will be working on specifically at Twitter, but there are plenty of issues to fix. When the company reported its earnings last quarter, the company showed continued stagnant growth and sent its stock into a nosedive. While Twitter has a cadre of very dedicated users, it’s proven a challenge for the company to find the right combination of services and user experience to attract and keep a wider audience, to help drive its bigger strategy of monetising through advertising. Krishnan will start October 2. so…I have some news. — Sriram Krishnan  (@sriramk) September 19, 2017   \n",

            "Facebook  has been reportedly working on a video chat device and a smart speaker that would use a new voice interface, to compete against the likes of Amazon and Google in the race to control your living room; and it’s also been testing as a voice search feature for its app. Today, the company’s head of design, Luke Woods, came out bullish on the promise of voice commands, squirmed when we asked him about Alexa apps, and simply shut down with a series of no-comments on the subject of hardware that used a voice interface. During an interesting session at TechCrunch Disrupt that ranged across topics like copying Snap (“In design school, we learned that there is nothing new anymore.”); solving hard problems (“We treat edge cases as stress cases.”) and the push to keep changing and developing design at Facebook (“There is a tendency to think we’ve got it all figured out, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth.”), Woods was asked for his thoughts about new interfaces like voice. He cautioned it was still something that doesn’t have the perfect product end point yet, but services like voice and voice search are promising. “What’s interesting about these [newer] areas is that they hold a huge amount of promise…these are some of the problems that people are most excited to solve,” he said. “We don’t know what form [AR and VR] are going to take at the end or what’s going to work.” Woods continued by describing voice search as “very promising. There are lots of exciting things happening…. I love to be able to talk to the car to navigate to a particular place. That’s one of many potential use cases.” Voice navigation for Facebook is another thing he touched on, but for a particular group of users: the company has already built voice search and voice descriptors for people who have impaired vision, to be able to interact with the social network, and navigate to different features. Then things got a little less direct. “How would Facebook on Alexa work?,” interviewer Josh Constine asked. “That’s a very interesting question!” Woods said, smiling. “No comment.” When asked how Facebook would work on Alexa, FB's head of design responds with a smile and no comment #TCDisrupt pic.twitter.com/kFerxuXCiX — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) September 18, 2017  Later, on the sidelines of the stage, Woods also declined to comment on whether Facebook is working on hardware of any kind that could use voice services, with another smile. The lack of response is at odds with some of the other evidence that has been piling up around Facebook and what it may be looking to launch in coming months and years. In the range of tests that we and others have spotted Facebook running in different countries, what’s notable is the profusion of voice-based services that are coming out. In July, a report emerged out of Taiwan that the company was building a speaker with a screen that would let users message each other and browse photos — which sounded somewhat like Facebook equivalent of the Alexa Show. The speaker, designed in the company’s secretive Building 8 hardware lab, was supposedly getting made for a Q1 2018 launch. Just a week later, Bloomberg appeared to corroborate the report out of Taiwan with another interesting twist: in addition to the speaker with a screen, there was another standalone speaker with no screen, akin to the Echo and Google’s Home hub. Then, late in August, BusinessInsider discovered that the speaker device was being built under the codename Aloha, with a launch date of May 2018. The voice noise did not end there. Earlier this month, Facebook code super sleuth Matt Navarra noted that Facebook’s iOS app contained a large amount of code related to voice search. These appear to be different from the accessibility voice features that Facebook has built. Facebook has made at least one interesting acquisition in speech and natural language recognition — the AI and natural language startup Wit.ai, whose team helped build Facebook’s bot strategy for its Messenger app. But in addition to that, it’s also been looking to hire engineers with expertise in speech and natural language processing (see here, here, here and here). These jobs mention other speech-based services that Facebook is working on, such as video captioning services for videos that are played on silent, but the expertise has wide applicability beyond that.

            "111 Report: Facebook gave special investigator Robert Mueller detailed info on Russian ad buys\n",
            "An official for Facebook  told TechCrunch that the company is “continuing to cooperate with the relevant U.S. authorities,” as investigations into the Russian hack of last year’s presidential election continue to expand. In the latest development, authorities are now investigating how agents used online advertising on social networks and search platforms, and tech companies are being forced to hand over new, sensitive information to investigators as a result. In some cases, that means providing different information to different investigations, as The Wall Street Journal is reporting today. Facebook has apparently turned over more detailed information to the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, than the company shared with Congress last week, the Journal reports. Mueller’s investigation has received copies of the Russian-bought ads and details about the specific account information and targeting criteria the buyers used to distribute their ads, according to the Journal, citing people familiar with the matter. It’s likely that Facebook was compelled to turn over the information because the investigating team received a search warrant. If indeed, Mueller is using warrants, then it’s likely that Facebook won’t be the only tech company that may be forced to reveal information about potential clandestine advertising buys, which Russian agents are alleged to have made in order to influence the U.S. election. The Journal reports that Mueller’s team could have gotten information that Facebook withheld from Congress because of concerns around privacy laws or fears of disrupting the Mueller probe. My guess is that Facebook is likely also thinking that the Mueller investigation is a tighter ship and less likely to leak details of the ads whereas Congressional staffers could leak like sieves. It’s clear that Facebook has no interest in revealing details of the ad buys, or telling individuals whether they were targets of what amounts to a Russian plot to influence the U.S. election. It’s something members of the tech community have taken Facebook to task for already. Secret political ads are by definition an attack on democracy. Their disclosure is not optional. Shocking FB continues to insist otherwise. — Pierre Omidyar (@pierre) September 9, 2017  We’ve reached out to the Office of the Special Counsel and for comment and will update if we hear back. Last week Facebook revealed that it had sold as much as $150,000 in political ads to pro-Kremlin entities between 2015 and 2017. It was part of a broader report that indicated 500 “inauthentic” accounts linked to Russia had purchased 5,000 ads from the company. The developments today relate to that same trove but are a sign of yet more data now being handed over to authorities. Last Wednesday, as the company released its assessment, Facebook representatives also spoke to Congress as part of ongoing House and Senate investigations into Russian interference in the election. Facebook even told The Washington Post, “there is evidence that some of the accounts are linked to a troll farm in St. Petersburg, referred to as the Internet Research Agency, though we have no way to independently confirm.” As we reported, the Internet Research Agency is widely known for its pro-Kremlin online propaganda campaigns, which U.S. intelligence agencies believe is backed by someone with close ties to the Russian intelligence community who is a close friend of Vladimir Putin’s. Facebook’s disclosure was the first time it admitted that Russians had reached out to voters during the elections. The company had previously denied that there were any ad buys made by Russian agents or anyone connected with the Russian government.  All of these discoveries and announcements come amid serious questions about the role of Russia in the last election … and whether the President Donald Trump’s campaign (or people associated with that campaign) colluded with the Russian government. Committees in both houses are writing up reports on the role Russia played in the election. It’s also worth noting that Facebook isn’t the only social media company to come under fire for either unwittingly or knowingly playing a role in disseminating propaganda on behalf of a foreign government. Twitter is also expected to come before congressional inquisitors in the coming weeks, according to a report from Reuters last week, quoting Democratic Senator Mark Warner. “It was my belief that the Russians were using those sites to interfere in our elections, and the first reaction from Facebook was, ‘No. You’re crazy.’” Warner said at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance conference in Washington. “I think what we saw yesterday in terms of their brief was the tip of the iceberg,” Warner said. He also told reporters he expected Twitter to soon brief the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the panels investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether members of President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. Facebook has been reluctant to share any details with the public and have extended that reticence to the Congressional investigators that are looking into Russian interference. The Journal reported that Facebook believes the data on ads could be protected under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Bi-partisan leadership from the Senate Intelligence Committee is pushing for company representatives to come to Capitol Hill and publicly walk Senators through how potential Russian agents came to advertise on the company’s social network. The Senate could compel Facebook executives to show up by issuing a subpoena… But subpoena power to testify is not the same as a warrant. Search warrants have more legal force behind them and mean that the company has to disclose more information than it would in live testimony.  \n",

            "Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of the popular open source web publishing software WordPress,  has said the community will be pulling away from using Facebook’s React JavaScript library over concerns about a patent clause in Facebook’s  open source license. In a blog post explaining the decision yesterday, Mullenweg said he had hoped to officially adopt React for WordPress — noting that Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com which he also founded, had already used React for the Calypso ground-up rewrite of WordPress.com a few years ago, while the WordPress community had started using it for its major Gutenberg core project. But he said he has changed his mind after seeing Facebook dig in behind the patent clause — which was recently added to the Apache Software Foundation’s (ASF) list of disallowed licenses. In the ASF’s ‘Category X’ list, where the React patent clause now resides, it writes: The Facebook BSD+Patents license includes a specification of a PATENTS file that passes along risk to downstream consumers of our software imbalanced in favor of the licensor, not the licensee, thereby violating our Apache legal policy of being a universal donor. The terms of Facebook BSD+Patents license are not a subset of those found in the ALv2, and they cannot be sublicensed as ALv2. Last month Facebook wrote its own blog post responding to the ASF decision — in which it conceded it hadn’t “done a good job of explaining the reasons” behind the patent clause. And went on to claim that it was necessary because Facebook’s business had “become a larger target for meritless patent litigation”, writing: We decided to add a clear patent grant when we release software under the 3-clause BSD license, creating what has come to be known as the BSD + Patents license. The patent grant says that if you’re going to use the software we’ve released under it, you lose the patent license from us if you sue us for patent infringement. We believe that if this license were widely adopted, it could actually reduce meritless litigation for all adopters, and we want to work with others to explore this possibility. We respect third party IP, including patents, and expect others to respect our IP too. The BSD + Patents license just intends to give our teams more room to make meaningful contributions to open source while decreasing our time spent fighting frivolous lawsuits. Regardless, Mullenweg said his concerns have not been assuaged. And he writes that he cannot, in good conscience, require users of the very widely used open source WordPress software to inherit the patent clause and associated legal risk. So he’s made the decision to ditch React. “I think Facebook’s clause is actually clearer than many other approaches companies could take, and Facebook has been one of the better open source contributors out there. But we have a lot of problems to tackle, and convincing the world that Facebook’s patent clause is fine isn’t ours to take on. It’s their fight,” he writes. He said the decision means there will be a delay to the Gutenberg project — of at least a few weeks — as it’s rewritten using a different library, noting this may push the release into next year. On the rewrite of Calypso, he said only that this will take “a lot longer”, adding: “Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the long-term consistency with core is worth more than a short-term hit to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.” We’ve reached out to Facebook for comment and will update this post with any response. The perceived risk attached to the patent clause hinges on how Facebook can revoke the patent license if a React user challenges its patents or sues the company for patent infringement — meaning Facebook could bring a patent infringement claim against a person or entity suing it for patent infringement. So companies, especially those with large patent portfolios, may well have concerns if they are using open source software which incorporates Facebook’s React framework — even if Automattic feels comfortable on its own account. Some of the fiercest critics of the patent clause have dubbed React a “‘Trojan horse’ into the open source community”. Writing on Hacker News in the wake of the ASF’s move, developer Kevinflo summed up his concerns thus: “Even if we paint all of their actions in the most favorable possible light, and even if the clause is a paper tiger as some have claimed, it doesn’t matter. This is not how open source should work. We should not have to debate for years if a project’s license is radioactive. Especially individual devs like myself who just want to use a great tool. We should be able to just use it, because it’s open and that’s what open means. This is so much worse than closed. It’s closed masquerading as open.” Florenzano is now celebrating the decision to move away from React… Can’t overstate how huge this is. @automattic moving away from  @reactjs over patents clause 👏👏👏👏https://t.co/QNbpGLUue5 — Kevin Florenzano (@kevinflo) September 15, 2017  Mullenweg said he has not yet decided on which library will replace React but added the decision will be “primarily” technical. “We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people,” he said, adding: “Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we’re always listening.” Comments on his blog post are largely supportive of the move — with one commentator calling it a “tough but important decision”, and others dubbing it a “wise” and a “good” decision. Although another warns against overreaction, writing: “Don’t over-react. There has been enough turmoil & churn in the WP ecosystem in the last 5, 6 years. Fb’s business size & range makes the clause scary. They will have to give it up, eventually.” This post was updated to clarify that Auttomatic owns WordPress.com, while Mullenweg is also co-founder of the open source platform, WordPress  \n",

            "In a swift response to the news that advertisers were able to target anti-Semitic phrases on Facebook, the social network has shut down “self-reported targeting fields” in the ad system until further notice. It was shown earlier today in a ProPublica report that Facebook’s  advertising system gladly surfaced categories like “How to burn jews” and “Hitler did nothing wrong.” Obviously Facebook itself didn’t invent these itself, but scraped them from profiles that had listed the phrases under such headings as “field of study.” This led to the offensive phrases being listed alongside ordinary hobbies and interests that advertisers may want to target. It’s an inconvenient blind spot to be exposed just now, while Facebook is under fire for inadvertently selling what appear to be politically motivated ads to a network of fake Russian profiles during election season. One wonders if there’s anyone to whom Facebook won’t sell ad space? But removing the fields in question from consideration for advertising is the right move, since the prospect of intelligently sorting through millions of real and imagined vocations for the occasional abuse is a daunting one. The fields will remain inadmissible as ad categories “until we have the right processes in place to help prevent this issue.”  \n",

            "Facebook  is turning its attention to Canada with a new AI research office in Montreal. Google and Microsoft already have outposts in the city and countless other tech companies, including Uber, have researchers based in Canada. McGill University’s Joelle Pineau will be leading Facebook’s AI efforts in Montreal. Pineau’s research focus tends to lean heavily on robotics and dialog systems, particularly applications of reinforcement learning. Dialog research and natural language processing (NLP) more broadly is one of the core interests of Facebook’s AI Research (FAIR) Lab for obvious reasons — Facebook is home to a lot of text. And Facebook M, its personal assistant, in particular relies heavily on dialog. With uncertainty in the American immigration system, Canada is emerging as a center for research work. While the U.S. still leads the world in AI talent, some of the best researchers come from abroad. Canada’s own schools like Waterloo and McGill (to name a few) are AI research centers and programs further abroad at schools like Tsinghua and Cambridge are exceedingly strong. With there still being a shortage of AI talent, Facebook’s office in Montreal will provide the company access to a secure pipeline of gifted researchers. While Yann LeCun, head of Facebook AI Research, said that immigration policy didn’t play into his team’s decision to expand to Montreal, he did note the clear benefits of operating in the region. “Part of the reason for establishing ourselves here is taking advantage of this pool of talent,” LeCun noted in an interview. “This didn’t factor into our decision, but immigration in Canada is more well organized than immigration into the U.S..” Facebook currently operates AI research centers in Paris, New York City and Menlo Park, employing about 105 researchers. The aim is to grow the Montreal group from its founding team of four to 30 or 40 FAIRly quickly. As part of this announcement, Facebook is donating money to McGill and the University of Montreal to support graduate students and help improve computational infrastructure. While working to hire a team for Facebook, Pineau will be maintaining her academic position at McGill. If you’re interested in reading some of Pineau’s work, including some particularly interesting applications of machine learning to medical use cases, you can find the papers on the McGill site.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be speaking about Facebook’s efforts in Montreal tomorrow morning at around 11am EST. The event will be live streamed here.  \n",

            "115 Facebook’s generation of ‘Jew Hater’ and other advertising categories prompts system inspection\n",
            "Update: Facebook  has disabled using the user-reported fields in question in its advertising system until further notice. Update 2: Google has disabled similar functionality in its own ad targeting system as well. (Details below) Facebook automatically generates categories advertisers can target, such as “jogger” and “activist,” based on what it observes in users’ profiles. Usually that’s not a problem, but ProPublica found that Facebook had generated anti-Semitic categories such as “Jew Hater” and “Hitler did nothing wrong,” which could be targeted for advertising purposes. The categories were small — a few thousand people total — but the fact that they existed for official targeting (and in turn, revenue for Facebook) rather than being flagged raises questions about the effectiveness — or even existence — of hate speech controls on the platform. Although surely countless posts are flagged and removed successfully, the failures are often conspicuous. ProPublica, acting on a tip, found that a handful of categories autocompleted themselves when their researchers entered “jews h” into the advertising category search box. To verify these were real, they bundled a few together and bought an ad targeting them, which indeed went live. Upon being alerted, Facebook removed the categories and issued a familiar-sounding strongly worded statement about how tough on hate speech the company is: We don’t allow hate speech on Facebook. Our community standards strictly prohibit attacking people based on their protected characteristics, including religion, and we prohibit advertisers from discriminating against people based on religion and other attributes. However, there are times where content is surfaced on our platform that violates our standards. In this case, we’ve removed the associated targeting fields in question. We know we have more work to do, so we’re also building new guardrails in our product and review processes to prevent other issues like this from happening in the future. The problem occurred because people were listing “jew hater” and the like in their “field of study” category, which is of course a good one for guessing what a person might be interested in: meteorology, social sciences, etc. Although the numbers were extremely small, that shouldn’t be a barrier to an advertiser looking to reach a very limited group, like owners of a rare dog breed. But as difficult as it might be for an algorithm to determine the difference between “History of Judaism” and “History of ‘why Jews ruin the world,'” it really does seem incumbent on Facebook to make sure an algorithm does make that determination. At the very least, when categories are potentially sensitive, dealing with personal data like religion, politics, and sexuality, one would think they would be verified by humans before being offered up to would-be advertisers. Facebook told TechCrunch that it is now working to prevent such offensive entries in demographic traits from appearing as addressable categories. Of course, hindsight is 20/20, but really — only now it’s doing this? It’s good that measures are being taken, but it’s kind of hard to believe that there was not some kind of flag list that watched for categories or groups that clearly violate the no-hate-speech provision. I asked Facebook for more details on this, and will update the post if I hear back. As Harvard’s Joshua Benton pointed out on Twitter, one can also target the same groups for Google ad words: Re: This story on FB allowing anti-Semitic ad targeting https://t.co/zR31joq02l I just tried & Google seems to let you target the same terms pic.twitter.com/HDIMZQTf7x — Joshua Benton (@jbenton) September 14, 2017  I feel like this is different somehow, although still troubling. You could put nonsense words into those keyword boxes and they would be accepted. On the other hand, Google does suggest related anti-Semitic phrases in case you felt like “Jew haters” wasn’t broad enough: And Google is happy to suggest some other search terms I might want to target to broaden my anti-Semitic reach pic.twitter.com/qZrT4UKigF — Joshua Benton (@jbenton) September 15, 2017  To me the Facebook mechanism seems more like a selection by Facebook of existing, quasi-approved (i.e. hasn’t been flagged) profile data it thinks fits what you’re looking for, while Google’s is a more senseless association of queries it’s had — and it has less leeway to remove things, since it can’t very well not allow people to search for ethnic slurs or the like. But obviously it’s not that simple. I honestly am not quite sure what to think. Google’s SVP of ads, Sridhar Ramaswamy, issued the following statement after disabling a number of offensive ad suggestions: Our goal is to prevent our keyword suggestions tool from making offensive suggestions, and to stop any offensive ads appearing. We have language that informs advertisers when their ads are offensive and therefore rejected. In this instance, ads didn’t run against the vast majority of these keywords, but we didn’t catch all these offensive suggestions. That’s not good enough and we’re not making excuses.  We’ve already turned off these suggestions, and any ads that made it through, and will work harder to stop this from happening again. Offensive terms will not see suggestions from Google, although it’s unclear how Google arrived at the set of terms or phrases it deems offensive.  \n",

            "116 Facebook Messenger Day hits 70M daily users as the app reaches 1.3B monthlies\n",
            "Facebook  has finally revealed how its Snapchat Stories clone is doing, though it’s not seeing the same explosive growth as Instagram or WhatApp’s versions. Messenger Day now sees 70 million daily users posting and viewing photos and video slideshows six months after launch. For comparison, Instagram Stories took just two months to get to 100 million users, while WhatsApp Status reached 175 million users in merely 10 weeks. Both of those now have 250 million daily users each while competitor Snapchat has 173 million dailies for its whole app. Meanwhile, Facebook Messenger as a whole continues its ascent, entrenching itself as the top cross-OS messaging app in the West. Messenger now has 1.3 billion monthly users, up from 1.2 billion in April and 1 billion in July 2016. That’s the same count as Facebook’s other chat product, WhatsApp.  Messenger’s growth rate has slowed slightly over the years. It took just six months to go from 800 million to 1 billion, and nine more months to get 1.2 billion, and five months to add the last 100 million. That could signal that Messenger is beginning to hit saturation in some core markets. Messenger’s closest competitors that aren’t owned by Facebook include China’s WeChat with 938 million monthly users as of May, China’s QQ with 861 million monthly users as of Q1 2017 and Snapchat with 173 million daily users as of Q2 2017 (though not all use it for messaging). Apple’s iMessage has also reasserted itself, transforming from a lackluster SMS replacement to dynamic experiences, including animations, an app platform and, in the upcoming iOS 11, Animoji you can control with your face using augmented reality.  Messenger has had a bit of a rocky year in terms of design. It rolled out an aggressive redesign that made the whole inbox just a layer on top of the Messenger Camera, with awkward round edges atop the rectangular screen. It later rolled back some of that styling, and moved to a tabbed inbox in May. The app’s Snapchat Stories clone Messenger Day launched in March to heavy criticism, with some saying the broadcast social media feature doesn’t fit in the chat utility and stole screen space from the message threads. Growth has been much slower than for its other Snapchat copies. Some Facebook lovers may have shifted usage to Instagram’s messaging feature Direct. It’s swelled to 375 million monthly users, and now offers both permanent and ephemeral messaging. Meanwhile, Facebook has struggled to make Messenger bots the ubiquitous utility it was hoping for. After a sloppy launch in 2016, Messenger has augmented bots with group chat capabilities, begun suggesting them through its AI assistant M and built a bot discovery section into Messenger. Still, they haven’t driven much buzz. And Facebook hasn’t added any new voice features to Messenger despite that rabid adoration for products like Amazon Alexa and Google Home.  On the plus side, Messenger’s video chat has proven popular. The feature hit 245 million monthly users as of December when Messenger added six-way split-screen group video chat reminiscent of teen app Houseparty. Now Messenger is doubling down with integration into Facebook’s full-fledged Houseparty clone called Bonfire that was just spotted in the wild yesterday. Rather than force Bonfire to grow from scratch, Messenger’s 1.3 billion users can instantly jump into the group video chats without downloading a separate app. Messenger has finally started to ratchet up monetization. Brands can pay to send Sponsored Messages to people who’ve already chatted with them, or buy display ads within the inbox, which rolled out in July.  If Messenger wants to keep growing, it must continue to copy the best features of its competitors while innovating where it has natural advantages through its ties to Facebook. One opportunity could be the video chat hardware device Facebook is reportedly building, codenamed Aloha. With a 13-inch to 15-inch, it could help people video chat with grandparents or other family that aren’t as familiar with smartphone apps. Facebook could parlay the device into an attack on home phones that could hold serious growth opportunities. Still, while chat may be the center of the mobile experience, and all of mobile is adapting to the visual communication era, Messenger can’t let the bells and whistles obstruct the speedy utility at its core.  \n",

            "117 Facebook ‘Snooze’ button temporarily hides people in your feed\n",
            "Sick of a friend’s non-stop vacation photos? Bored of hearing about some business Page’s big launch? One of your groups won’t shut up about their upcoming get-together? Now Facebook  has a Snooze button that lets you temporarily unfollow friends, Pages or Groups for 24 hours, 7 days or 30 days. The Snooze button could deter people from permanently unfollowing, unliking or unfriending things on Facebook while still giving them control over what they see. Facebook benefits from you maintaining a dense social network, whether for ad targeting or just surfacing an important life update from a distant acquaintance. So now when you’re annoyed with someone or something, you can solve the problem without severing the connection. TechCrunch spotted Snooze this morning on Facebook’s desktop site in the U.S., and we are awaiting comment from the company about the status of the feature. [Update 11:30am PT: A Facebook spokesperson confirms it’s testing the Snooze feature, telling TechCrunch “We’re testing new ways to give people control over their News Feeds so they can stay connected with the stories they find most relevant.”]  To Snooze someone, tap the drop-down arrow in the top right of someone’s post. Now instead of just an unfollow option, there’s “Unfollow or Snooze.” Tap that, and you can choose whether you want to Snooze someone for a day, a week, a month or permanently unfollow them. Facebook has been trying to settle in on the best way to let you control the News Feed without being confusing. In 2012 it offered a “See Less” option on friends’ profiles. But eventually Facebook found this was puzzling for users, since they’d still see that person in their feed, so it wasn’t clear if the option actually did anything. By 2014, Facebook had dropped “See Less” in favor of a definitive “Unfollow” button that let you stay friends but banish them from your feed. With Snooze, it’s found a way to decrease the noise from a chatty person, group or Page in a way that’s obvious and intuitive, but doesn’t prohibit Facebook from showing you their most important posts further down the line.  Pages and Groups may benefit from Snooze, as it could reduce the chances of someone unliking or leaving them. But it also should inspire them not to overshare or spam, otherwise they could be put in time-out. Facebook already constantly modulates how much you see of someone based on implicit signals, like if you Like, click, comment on or share their posts. It will surely use Snoozing as a signal that it should show you less of someone when they’re allowed to reappear. But if we’re going to spend so much of our lives browsing the News Feed curated by Facebook’s faceless algorithm, it’s nice to see the company equip us humans with more than just binary controls.  \n",

            "118 Facebook centralizes its crisis response tools in a new hub called Crisis Response\n",
            "Facebook  today is announcing a new feature called Crisis Response, designed to make it easier for people to find out more about recent crises and access various to tools to support recovery, including Safety Check, Community Help and Fundraisers. This trio of tools had previously existed – the difference is that all the resources will now be located in a single place. The social network has been steadily upgrading its capabilities to connect people in the wake of a crisis or natural disaster. In February, it introduced Community Help, which allows locals to find and offer assistance to victims of a disaster, including things like water, food, baby supplies, or even shelter. The feature was integrated into Facebook’s Safety Check, the tool that lets you mark yourself as safe after a disaster, or check on the status of friends and family. This June, Safety Check was expanded again, to include the ability to fundraise for disaster victims. More recently, Safety Check appeared as its own option within Facebook’s main navigation. Now, Facebook is centralizing not only Safety Check, but also other tools in the new Crisis Response hub. In addition to Safety Check, Community Help, and Fundraisers, the new destination will include more crisis-related content, too, like links to articles, photos, and videos from public posts that can help people learn more about the crisis. This information along with Safety Check activations may also appear in the News Feed, at times. By offering more information about what occurred, combined with imagery and video, people may be more inspired to help, is the belief here. The introduction of the new hub comes at a time when people have turned to social media in large numbers after not being able to get help quickly through traditional channels, like 911, in the wake of a crisis. The 911 system is limited by the number of phone lines, dispatchers, and resources that can be deployed – and it quickly became overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster at hand, in the case of Harvey’s flood victims. The usage of social media then skyrocketed as a result, with people turning to the larger crowd in desperation for assistance. Some people began posting their cries for help to Twitter; others used the walkie-talkie app Zello; and neighbors signed up in droves for Nextdoor. Facebook, too, says it has seen its users coming together to help one another in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. For example, a man drove 90 minutes on his boat after seeing a call on Facebook asking for people who could help rescue those trapped in their homes. A daughter of an Irma survivor on St. John fundraised over $2,000 to help her mom recover. People have found loved ones were safe through Safety Check, organized help over Messenger, or found shelter through Community Help.  But Facebook wasn’t the only tool that helped people after Harvey – Twitter was more efficient, at times, as well as Zello. With the new hub, Facebook aims to solidify its position as a place where users can connect for help. The Crisis Response hub will appear in the weeks ahead on the Facebook desktop homepage, and in the Facebook menu in the mobile app, the company says.  \n",

            "119 Facebook’s Eddie O’Neil takes over Platform as Deb Liu grows Marketplace\n",
            "There’s a new czar running Facebook’s  developer platform tools. Because Facebook’s classifieds feature Marketplace is growing, it will now command the full attention of Deb Liu, who previously ran Platform. She’s now formally the VP of Marketplace. Eddie O’Neil, a six-year Facebook employee who was a director of product management after coming from Salesforce engineering, will be the new head of Facebook Platform. He’s in charge of Facebook Analytics, Login, Account Recovery, Social Plugins and support for SDKs, APIs and other developer community products. TechCrunch heard from a source that Facebook’s Platform was undergoing an organizational change, and the company now confirms the leadership changes. The organization change emphasizes just how important Facebook sees Marketplace. The feature lets people buy and sell goods from people in their area. As of May, Marketplace saw 18 million items posted per month in the U.S., and expanded to 17 countries across Europe in August after rolling out in Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand and the U.K.  Marketplace isn’t just furniture and electronics any more. Now it supports Jobs listings, Daily Deals thanks to a partnership with eBay, event tickets through Eventbrite and Ticketmaster, and products from the Shop section of Facebook business pages. Next, Facebook plans to let car dealership sell vehicles through Marketplace, and allow real estate agents to list apartments there. Facebook has a huge opportunity to use its ubiquity, non-stop usage and real identity system to outcompete Craigslist, the long-standing leader in online classifieds. The biggest problem with Craigslist is people don’t trust the strangers they want to transact with as there are no profiles or social graphs. With Facebook Marketplace, you could look to see if you have friends in common with someone you want to buy from, or that at least they have a filled-out profile with photos and friendships so they’re less likely to be a scammer or serial killer. Building Marketplace into a worthy Craigslist competitor requires dedicated leadership. Liu has been at Facebook for a stunning eight years after stints at PayPal and eBay. She previously ran the Facebook Credits game currency program and was a director of platform monetization. I’ve always found Liu to be both deeply knowledgable of Facebook product and also warm and sociable in the ways necessary to understand what people want in order to grow a new part of Facebook. Meanwhile, Eddie O’Neil will handle Facebook’s Platform division, which includes Facebook’s login tools for third-party apps, as well as outside app analytics. He reports to Ami Vora, Facebook’s VP of Product Management. The Facebook Platform turned 10 years old this year, and we wrote this deep dive into its rocky but successful journey. Most recently, the Platform team launched Express Login for re-downloaded apps, voice-call verification for login, UI customization and analytics for Account Kit that helps people login to third-party apps via phone or email and delegated account recovery where users can get into third-party apps via Facebook if they lose their password.  However, Facebook’s developer tool offering has shrunk since it shut down its Parse mobile app platform early this year. The idea was always that if Facebook strengthened relationships with developers through offering free tools, they’d end up buying its tools to grow, too. Now Facebook is a well-entrenched growth channel for app developers, and has so many diverse projects going on that it needed for focus. But as the age of augmented reality approaches, Facebook will need all the cred with developers it can get. The physical world is too big for Facebook to fill with AR experiences by itself. As it starts to compete with Apple ARKit and Google ARCore, Facebook will have to rely on legions of developers who trust its technology platforms.  \n",

            "120 Facebook tests Bonfire group video chat as app and in Messenger\n",
            "Facebook  has been quietly testing a new standalone group video chat app, called Bonfire, which allows up to eight friends to engage in conversation as well as use special effects, similar to those you’d find in apps like Instagram and Snapchat. But upon hands-on testing, TechCrunch has learned Bonfire also lets users join chats straight from Messenger without downloading Bonfire itself. While the Bonfire app is currently only available in Denmark, users with it can invite people from all over the world to join their chats via Messenger. This strategy could allow Facebook to create a home for Bonfire with dedicated access to launching a multi-screen group video chat, but also let Messenger’s 1.2 billion monthly users instantly join in. That might save it from the lackluster traction that led to the shut downs of other standalone Facebook apps like newsreader Paper, Snapchat alternative Slingshot, news alert app Notify, and video profile app Lifestage.  The Next Web’s Matt Navarra first spotted the app in the Denmark App Store. The Verge first reported on Facebook building Bonfire in July. TechCrunch reached out to Facebook for comment on the app and when it might become available in the US. Here’s what a Facebook spokesperson told us: “At Facebook Inc we continue to build and test new products and services. We already have many great experiences for people to video chat in groups, or as individuals, across the family of apps, including Messenger. We are interested in how everyone uses technology and how we can build great experiences for them. We’re running a very small test in Denmark of an app we call Bonfire. We have nothing further to share at this time.” By nature of its one-country launch, the indication is that this is clearly a test Facebook is performing, and one that seems to cater to the growing popularity of group video chat. The Bonfire app, which has been downloaded only around 2,000 times, said TNW, was first launched on the Danish App Store in mid-August, then updated this month with the ability to do special effects. Bonfire is a blatant clone of Houseparty, a teen-focused group video chat from the makers of the Meerkat livestreaming app that received a recent $50 million funding round led by Sequoia. Recently, Skype updated its app to improve its group chat feature with fun features like emoticons, while a number of newcomers – like iMessage-based Fam – have entered the scene. The app also competes with Houseparty, Airtime, ooVoo, Marco Polo, and many others on group video, and, to some extent, the apps for co-watching videos, like Tumblr’s Cabana or YouTube’s Uptime. You can join a Bonfire chat straight from Messenger, and keep using Messenger with Bonfire inlaid as picture-in-picture. Unlike the other apps in this space, Facebook’s Bonfire seems to designed not only as a way to hang out with friends in a private space through face-to-face conversations, but also a way to feed content back to Facebook’s existing social networking apps, including Facebook itself, Instagram and Messenger. You’re able to take screenshots of your video chat and then share them to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and elsewhere without leaving the chat. While chatting on Bonfire, you can switch the screen format from everyone getting equal sized boxes to one where it switches most of the screen to show the person speaking. If you’re in Messenger, you’ll receive a notification if you’re asked to join a Bonfire call, though you can also keep using Messenger with your Bonfire windows inlaid picture-in-picture in the corner. Messenger already has its own split-screen group video calling feature. But that app is still designed as a utility, with the video feature buried inside. Bonfire brings it to the forefront so you can quickly jump into a chat, but offers the Messenger integration so friends don’t have to go through the chore of downloading a separate app right away.  Facebook has spent the last two years aggressively pushing Facebook Live. But the fact is that not everyone is comfortable performing for an audience. Bonfire lets people “live chill” with friends, offering the urgency and constant engagement of live, but with the low-stress feel of chatting with friends.  \n",

            "121 Facebook bans monetization of violence, porn, drugs, hate\n",
            "Facebook  wants content creators to earn money, but not at the expense of the family friendly social network it’s built, or the integrity of its advertising clients. So today Facebook established formal rules for what kinds of content can’t be monetized with Branded Content, Instant Articles, and mid-roll video Ad Breaks. These include depictions of death or incendiary social issues even as part of news or an awareness campaign. This is a big deal because it could shape the styles of content created for Facebook Watch, the new original programming hub its launched where publishers earn 55% of ad revenue. Facebook also plans to give advertisers more transparency into who sees their campaigns and where so they know their brand isn’t being placed next to disagreeable content. In the coming months Facebook will begin showing pre-campaign analytics of which publishers are eligible to carry an advertiser’s campaigns on their Instant Articles, video ad breaks, and off-site Audience Network inventory. That will start rolling out next week with full-lists available by October. And in the coming months, Facebook will provide post-campaign reporting on all the placements where ads were shown.  Finally, Facebook is taking more steps towards third-party verification against ad fraud. Facebook admits it’s been accused of “grading our own homework”, VP of global marketing solutions Carolyn Everson writes. That’s after several scandals involving bugs messing up ad metrics reported to clients, and agency execs claiming video ad viewability rates are only 20% to 30%, well below industry benchmarks. That’s why Facebook is joining the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG) “Certified Against Fraud” program. It’s also seeking accreditation from the Media Ratings Council over the next 18 months for its ad impression reporting, third-party viewability, and two-second minimum view time video ad buying. It’s also working on adding DoubleVerify and Meetrics to its existing list of 24 third-party ad measurement partners. These certifications and analytics could give Facebook’s advertisers confidence that their ads aren’t being shown next to bad content, are actually being viewed, are being counted properly. That could in turn convince them to pour more cash into Facebook, which earned $9.32 billion in revenue and $3.89 billion in profit last quarter. Today’s formalization of monetization rules unifies Facebook’s existing Community Standards, Page Terms, and Payment terms, plus goes into more specificity about exactly what can’t be monetized. Facebook says it will notify publishers if ads are removed from their content, and they can appeal the decisions. Here’s Facebook’s list of prohibited content types: Misappropriation of Children’s Characters – Content that depicts family entertainment characters engaging in violent, sexualized, or otherwise inappropriate behavior, including videos positioned in a comedic or satirical manner. For example, situations where characters sustain serious personal injury, are involved in vile or shocking acts, or involved in behavior such as smoking or drinking . Tragedy & Conflict -Content that focuses on real world tragedies, including but not limited to depictions of death, casualties, physical injuries, even if the intention is to promote awareness or education. For example, situations like natural disasters, crime, self-harm, medical conditions and terminal illnesses. Debated Social Issues – Content that is incendiary, inflammatory, demeaning or disparages people, groups, or causes is not eligible for ads. Content that features or promotes issues attacks on people or groups is generally not eligible for ads, even if in the context of news or awareness purposes. Violent Content – Content that is depicting threats or acts of violence against people or animals, where this is the focal point and is not presented with additional context. Examples includes content featuring fights, gore, beatings of either animals or people, or excessively graphic violence in the course of video gameplay. Adult content – Content where the focal point is nudity or adult content, including depictions of people in explicit or suggestive positions, or activities that are overly suggestive or sexually provocative. Prohibited Activity – Content that depicts, constitutes, facilitates, or promotes the sale or use of illegal or illicit products, services or activities. Examples include content that features coordinated criminal activity, drug use, or vandalism. Explicit Content – Content that depicts overly graphic images, blood, open wounds, bodily fluids, surgeries, medical procedures, or gore that is intended to shock or scare. Drugs or Alcohol use –  Content depicting or promoting the excessive consumption of alcohol, smoking, or drug use. Inappropriate Language – Content should not contain excessive use of derogatory language, including language intended to offend or insult particular groups of people. Most interestingly, Facebook isn’t distinguishing between some publishers that glorify this content and those that share it to drive awareness or condemnation. Instead, it’s all lumped together. That could subtly push publishers away from covering some of the more devisive topics in the world from war to social justice because they know they can’t earn money from it. Again, while Facebook has tried to avoid becoming a media company, setting these aggressive rules on what can’t be monetized is akin to making an editorial decision about what content it approves. While publishers are still free to share some of this content as long as it abides by Facebook’s standard policies, monetary incentives could inspire self-censorship.  \n",

            "122 Facebook-backed Telecom Infra Project adds a new focus on millimeter wave tech for 5G\n",
            "The Telecom Infra Project (TIP), the Facebook-backed open-source hardware and software group of over 450 telecom stakeholders like Broadcom, Intel, Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, Telefonica, SK Telecom and Juniper Networks, today announced a new project group that will focus on millimeter wave networks. The appropriately named “Millimeter Wave Networks Project Group” (mmWave) will be co-chaired by Facebook and Deutsche Telekom and will focus on bringing more bandwidth to dense, highly populated areas. While TIP started out with a focus on technologies that could bring better connectivity to rural areas, it has recently also launched a number of projects that focused on cities. The mmWave group will work on new networking solutions for the 60GHz band, a frequency that’ll play a major role in the move to 5G networks and that, in the past, was mostly used for military communications. That’s also the same frequency that the Terragraph project uses to cover city blocks with internet connectivity. The mmWave group’s focus is slightly different, but it’s also looking at how to use 60GHz networking to provide wireless coverage in cities for IoT devices.  “60GHz wireless systems could also enable smart city applications, where data is collected from a massive number of sensors, smart utility meters, smart parking meters, traffic cameras and even street lights so city planners can make better informed decisions,” the group explains in today’s announcement. “The goal is to make cities function more efficiently and to improve quality of life.” In addition, mmWave is also looking at how to use this tech to offer fixed wireless access to homes and offices as a last-mile solution that’s backed by high-speed cabled networks. You wouldn’t connect directly to the 60GHz network, though, but instead the connection would terminate with a node on a building that then provides Ethernet or Wi-Fi connections inside the building. Similarly, the group is also looking at how its 60GHz systems can be used for mobile backhaul between the carrier’s networks and small cells and Wi-Fi access points. The idea here is that these systems could help the carriers save quite a bit of money because they wouldn’t have to put fiber into the ground. “We are excited to see the TIP community come together to investigate technologies that have the potential to connect more people around the word,” Facebook’s  Yael Maguire told us. “Millimeter wave systems will allow mobile operators to build denser urban networks that are able to support the new wave of wireless applications coming online.”  \n",

            "Instagram  is announcing several new features for advertisers today. The biggest is probably the expansion of the Canvas ad format to Instagram Stories (which supposedly reach 250 million people daily). While businesses have been able to advertise in Instagram Stories since earlier this year, this introduces a new, full-screen, interactive ad format to that mix. “With the ability to utilize Facebook’s  fast-loading full screen Canvas format in Instagram Stories, marketers are able to use the creative versatility of Canvas to tell compelling brand and product stories,” Instagram writes in a blog post. “This seamless extension of the full screen experience allows advertisers to capture the attention of customers with just a single ad.” Instagram also says businesses will now be able to upload the media they used for organic Instagram Stories and save them for use in future ad campaigns through the Power Editor and Ads Manager. Plus, the company wants advertisers to incorporate Instagram Stories into their campaigns across Facebook properties — it says Stories can now be added to Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network campaigns through placement optimization. And here’s some Instagram Stories news that’s not focused on advertisers: The company says users will be able to share Stories as a direct message to their friends. (If you don’t want people sharing your Stories this way, you can turn off the feature.)  \n",

            "124 Facebook has pulled Instant Articles off Messenger\n",
            "While Facebook  prepares to offer readers a way to subscribe and pay for news directly from inside its app, the social network continues to tinker with how it presents publishers’ content elsewhere. In the latest development, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Facebook has removed Instant Articles — Facebook’s self-hosted, faster-loading article format for mobile — from Messenger. “As we continue to refine and improve Instant Articles — and in order to have the greatest impact on people and publishers — we’re focusing our investment in Instant Articles in the Facebook core app and are no longer offering Instant Articles in Messenger,” a spokesperson said. “We believe that Messenger is an exciting channel for new and interesting news consumption experiences, including the opportunity to build unique messaging experiences in Messenger that many publishers (including TechCrunch) have executed successfully via the Messenger Platform.” Instant Articles was a pared-down article format launched by the social network in 2015 with the aim of speeding up page load time by ten times compared to the mobile web, thereby cutting down the number of people dropping off when reading on mobile devices. (The “Instant” feel and performance is something that Facebook appears keen to develop: just this week it started to test Instant Videos.) Originally designed to run in the News Feed, a year ago Facebook expanded Instant Articles to Messenger as part of a wider strategy to enhance content on its popular messaging platform, which today has over 1.2 billion users. But while Instant Articles does what its name suggests, there have been some teething pains with the format. Several high profile publications and publishers, including the Guardian, Forbes, Hearst, The New York Times, Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, ESPN, CBS News, NPR, Financial Times, and VICE News either pulled, scaled back, or never participated in Instant Articles in the first place because of the lack of monetization on the platform. There have also been issues with traffic reporting with the format. Facebook has tried to respond to these problems to make it more publisher-friendly. It’s periodically corrected its traffic reports and introduced new analytics tools to measure it better; there are now ‘native ads’ in the format alongside links for further reading; readers can sign up for more content (specifically newsletters) at the bottom of Instant Articles; and to widen the content funnel, Facebook has expanded Instant Articles to support Google AMP and Apple News (two other fast-loading formats for those respective platforms). From what we understand, though, some attribution issues have remained. Specifically, you can’t easily add UTM parameters to the end of Instant Article URLs to track who is clicking and where traffic is coming from. “Tracking Instant Article content is much more difficult than a traditional link, so brands and publishers are likely finding it hard to gauge traction of the platform,” one source said. When Facebook first launched Instant Articles in Messenger, some believed that the expansion would help boost the format at a time when the company was de-emphasizing publishers in the News Feed algorithm, putting them behind friends. It’s fair to wonder how and if that boost ever played out. One thing that appears more clear: Instant Articles — whether on Messenger or not — remain an anchor in how Facebook wants to work with publishers. In the latest development, the company has confirmed that it is collaborating with publishers on a paid-content model that it will start testing later this year, where publishers will be able to keep the proceeds and control the subscription process (with Facebook not taking a cut). A report in the WSJ ahead of his announcement described how it will work: readers will be able to subscribe to and pay for publications directly from Facebook’s mobile app, but publishers who want to participate in the paid-content model will have to publish their content natively to Facebook by way of Instant Articles, according to the report. The Instant Articles removal from Messenger, from what we understand, may not even be permanent. In other words, for those who have long been asking Facebook to introduce a paid-content model — the idea being this can offset the fact that Facebook likely makes way more in ad revenue than publishers ever will from the content that’s shared and read on there — Instant Articles may become the stick to their revenue carrot.

            "125 Facebook is testing a feature for mentorships between users\n",
            "Earlier this year, Facebook  signalled a plan to move into LinkedIn’s territory with the launch of job advertising. Now it appears to be taking another step to help develop the professional you. TechCrunch has learned that Facebook is testing a way to use its social network to link up users who are looking for mentorships, either as mentors or mentees. Our first look at the mentoring service came from a source, who had found a couple of references to mentoring in Facebook’s code. They appear to be fragments from a set of guidelines for mentors, introducing them to the program:   Later, we saw that another person, social media manager Matt Navarra, spotted an internal run of how the feature would look on the mobile app. It appears that the app matches a mentee’s interests up with those of the mentor’s, and by way of introduction, gives them a list of points they have in common, including friends, education, geographic location and — most importantly — profession:  Working on a mentorship service would be a logical step for Facebook for a few reasons. The first has to do with its leader’s ambitions. In May, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a post about his plan this year to visit every state in the U.S. where had yet to spend much time, in particular meeting with different groups that highlighted persistent social issues in the US (and no, Zuckerberg insists he’s not interested in running for political office). In that post, he noted ways that he thought Facebook could help people improve their lot in life. One area he honed in on in particular: By leveraging the size of the social network, Facebook could facilitate mentoring relationships to help people raise their job prospects. Zuckerberg also noted that he was starting to build this with teams at Facebook. “Facebook has been focused on helping you connect with people you already know,” he wrote. “We’ve built AI systems to recommend ‘People You May Know’. But it might be just as important to also connect you with people you should know — mentors and people outside your circle who care about you and can provide a new source of support and inspiration. There are a number of models for how this might work. The Peace Corps creates service opportunities where people exchange culture and build new relationships. Perhaps we could build a new digital peace corps. Another model is Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, where people who have struggled with these challenges and overcome them go on to become mentors for others, with the hope of training them to one day become mentors themselves. This is something I’ve only recently started studying and working with our teams at Facebook to build. The second reason this makes sense has to do with Facebook’s development of career services. As we noted, earlier this year, the company finally took the (long anticipated) plunge into recruitment, letting businesses that have Pages on Facebook now augment them with ads for jobs. The move was seen by many as a direct competitive hit to Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, which is far smaller in size (around 500 million users compared to Facebook’s 2 billion) but has a reputation as the go-to social network for the working world — a place where people go to create a public, professional profile for themselves, to network with others in their field, for career development and to look for jobs. Interestingly, just earlier this summer, LinkedIn unveiled its own free mentoring program, as a way of complementing its existing business and to drive more career-related traffic to the site. Offering a mentoring service could be a way for Facebook, too, to drive more traffic to its job-listings and to build its reputation as a place to develop your career. The third reason this makes sense relates to a more general trend at Facebook itself. As the company matures and we reach our fill of reconnecting with people we knew in college and high school, jobs and current social lives, Facebook has been on the hunt for more ways of leveraging its social network, and building even more connections across it (beyond actual friends) to boost engagement. These have included various twists on the basic idea of discovering yet more people on the network, people who may not be in your immediate circle but match your interests and location, or are friends of friends who you have yet to connect with, or might be someone you might like to actually meet, Tinder-style, based on compatible interests. It’s also included Facebook developing a completely new kind of social graph: Workplace, an enterprise communications service for teams and larger organizations. What we’ve seen of the mentorship service feels like it has been developed in the same vein as the people discovery feature, with the listing of common friends and other compatibility markers. But mentoring has a key difference: some of the new discover people features raise questions of just how much we want to connect with those on Facebook who we don’t actually know or consider friends already. To some the service can even feel a little stalkerish. Mentoring relationships, on the other hand, are more mutually complicit and separate to any expectation of friendship — despite the direct connections and private chats you will have with each other. It signals a new phase for Facebook, but one that is not out of step with its move into services like Workplace, job ads, and commercial activities like Marketplace. We have contacted Facebook for comment and will update this post as and if we learn more.  \n",

            "126 Facebook tests pre-loaded ‘Instant Videos’\n",
            "Facebook  doesn’t want you to burn through your mobile data plan just to keep watching its videos. That’s why it’s testing a new feature called Instant Videos that downloads and caches Facebook videos to your phone while you’re on Wi-Fi so you can watch them later on the go for free. Users will see lightning bolt icons on pre-loaded videos. The Instant Video feature is reminiscent of Instant Articles, Facebook’s hosted content format that loads much faster than mobile websites so users don’t drop off waiting for a publisher’s articles to appear. Because videos load even slower than web pages, publishers might be keen to get involved to ensure maximum viewability for their clips. The feature could also benefit Facebook’s new Watch tab of original video content, allowing it to cache episodes so people could watch them on a train or elsewhere that they might not have a strong connection or want to use up their data plan watching longer-form videos. Facebook confirms to TechCrunch that the Instant Video test is available to a small percentage of Android users. A screenshot of Instant Videos was first shared by “Devesh Logendran” using a pseudonym to TNW’s director of social media Matt Navarra. Now we’ve confirmed with Facebook that the goal is to remove data costs as a barrier to watching its videos. Previously, Facebook has tried to adapt its service for differing bandwidth and data prices by re-ranking News Feed to prioritize low file-size content while downranking videos if you’re on a slow connection, or replaying stories you’d already seen. While Instant Articles has mostly focused on the speed and convenience of reading news on Facebook, Instant Video focuses on the cost and accessibility. That could make the feature a major boon to Facebook’s efforts in the developing world. There, mobile data prices can be quite high compared to average incomes, and spotty network connections can make watching video frustrating. But if Facebook wants to be the social network of tomorrow, not just today, it knows it must whole-heartedly embrace video, which can deliver more vivid entertainment and interpersonal connection than text or photos. Interaction with mobile video is skyrocketing, according to a NewsWhip study shared by eMarketer showing a massive 53 percent year-over-year increase in engagement with news outlet videos on Instagram. Video also carries lucrative advertisements that are closer to the television commercials that brands are accustomed to making. Getting people accustomed to watching organic videos can make them more receptive to watching video ads. Plus, Facebook is starting to allow video creators and publishers to insert video ad breaks into the middle of their clips, and splits the revenue, with 55 percent going to the creator. Instant Videos could potentially include these ad breaks. By testing Instant Videos on Android, Facebook is laying the groundwork for both serving the developing world where iPhones are more rare, and more budget-conscious teens in the developed world. Combining forward-thinking accessibility initiatives with its engineering prowess and ubiquity could help Facebook excel beyond YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter and other competitors that also see video as the future.  \n",

            "127 Facebook fined €1.2M for privacy violations in Spain\n",
            "Another privacy-related fine for Facebook  in Europe: The Spanish data protection regulator has issued a €1.2M (~$1.4M) fine against the social media behemoth for a series of violations regarding its data-harvesting activities. Spain’s AEPD said an investigation into how Facebook collects, stores and uses data for advertising purposes found it is doing so without obtaining adequate user consent. It says it identified two serious infringements and one very serious infringement of data protection law — with the total sanction breaking down to €300,000 for each of the first breaches and €600,000 for the second. The regulator found Facebook collects data on ideology, sex, religious beliefs, personal tastes and navigation — either directly, through users’ use of its services or from third party pages — without, in its judgement, “clearly informing the user about the use and purpose”. Not obtaining express consent of users to process sensitive personal data is classified as a very serious offense under local DP law. Facebook’s use of web browsing cookies was also found in violation of privacy laws, with the regulator saying it confirmed users are not informed that their information will be processed through the use of cookies when they are browsing non-Facebook pages that contain Facebook’s ‘Like’ button social plug in — noting that while some of the use of this data is declared as being for advertising, other use is “secret”, i.e. not disclosed by the company. “This situation also occurs when users are not members of the social network but have ever visited one of its pages, as well as when users who are registered on Facebook browse through third party pages, even without logging on to Facebook. In these cases, the platform adds the information collected in said pages to the one associated with your account in the social network. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the information provided by Facebook to users does not comply with data protection regulations,” it noted. The regulator is also unhappy that Facebook does not delete harvested data once it has finished using it — saying it had been able to verify Facebook does not delete web browsing habits data, but  in fact “retains and reuses it later associated with the same user”. It also found this to be true even when the company had been explicitly requested to delete data by a user. “Regarding data retention, when a social network user has deleted his account and requests the deletion of the information, Facebook captures and treats information for more than 17 months through a deleted account cookie. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the personal data of the users are not canceled in full or when they are no longer useful for the purpose for which they were collected or when the user explicitly requests their removal, according to the requirements of the LOPD [local data protection law], which represents a serious infringement,” it said. The AEPR, which noted it liaised with other DPAs — in Belgium, France, Germany (Hamburg) and the Netherlands, which also have their own separate investigations into these issues, initiated following Facebook’s 2015 T&Cs change — said Facebook’s existing privacy policy was judged to contain “generic and unclear terms”, and to “inaccurately” refer to the use it will make of the data it collects. The regulator asserted that a Facebook user “with an average knowledge of the new technologies does not become aware of the collection of data, nor of their storage and subsequent treatment, nor of what they will be used”. It also points out that unregistered Internet users would not be unaware that the social network collects their browsing data — something that has already got Facebook into trouble with other European DPAs. Commenting on the regulator’s action, a Facebook spokesperson told us the company intends to appeal the decision, while also noting that its European business is (currently) regulated under Irish data protection rules, where its EU HQ is sited. It provided the following statement: We take note of the DPA’s decision with which we respectfully disagree. Whilst we value the opportunities we’ve had to engage with the DPA to reinforce how seriously we take the privacy of people who use Facebook, we intend to appeal this decision. As we made clear to the DPA, users choose which information they want to add to their profile and share with others, such as their religion. However, we do not use this information to target adverts to people. Facebook has long complied with EU data protection law through our establishment in Ireland. We remain open to continuing to discuss these issues with the DPA, whilst we work with our lead regulator the Irish Data Protection Commissioner as we prepare for the EU’s new data protection regulation in 2018. The size of the AEPR fine is of course a mere pinprick for Facebook whose 2016 revenue was $27.64BN. So really its appeal against the fine is about the company trying to bat away any perception that it violates privacy by refuting the substance of the violations being asserted here. But seen through the prism of stricter incoming EU data protection rules, under the new GDPR regime which comes into force next May, there are certainly serious financial considerations for Facebook’s business pertaining to privacy — as the new EU regime includes a far larger stick to beat companies that are judged to have violated data protection rules while also tightening up privacy rules by, for example, expanding the definition of personal data and giving EU citizens the right to ask for their data to be deleted. Companies will be facing fines of up to 4% of their global annual turnover for privacy violations under GDPR. So, in Facebook’s case, privacy-related fines could start to scale to over a billion dollars. And penalties of that size aren’t something the tech giant can too often and too easily sweep under its revenue carpet. Even as GDPR strengthens the consent requirements for processing personal data, and expands the risk of holding and processing lots of personal data. In addition, a company like Facebook, which processes data across multiple EU Member States’ territories, may find the new regulation creates a situation where it faces more concerted action from other DPAs, i.e. beyond their local data authority where they’ve established a European base. So, in Facebook’s case, it may not so easily be able to claim to be only under the jurisdiction of the Irish DPA. And in Europe, it’s fair to say that some DPAs are decided more pro-privacy than others. Asked about its GDPR preparations, Facebook previously told us it has designated a cross-functional team to “fully analyze the legislation and help us understand what this would mean from a legal, policy and product perspective” — saying this is “the largest cross functional team in the history of the Facebook family”. It is also now looking to recruit a data protection officer — a position mandated under GDPR. “Ahead of next May we are working with our product, design and engineering teams to enhance existing products and build new products in a way that simultaneously provides an intuitive, user-centric experience and permits us to meet our obligations under the GDPR,” added Stephen Deadman, Facebook’s deputy chief global privacy officer, in a statement.  \n",

            "128 Facebook adds a dedicated ‘Movies’ section offering showtimes and ticket sales\n",
            "Some Facebook  users have noticed a new section called “Movies” appearing in the mobile app’s main navigation. The feature, which has just appeared for many U.S. Facebook users, offers a way to see which movies are playing nearby, available showtimes and a list of local theaters and their movie selections. The section is powered through an integration with Fandango’s and Atom Tickets’ booking services, which means you can also buy a movie ticket right from the “Movies” section itself. This is not the first time Facebook has powered movie ticket sales, to be clear. Last fall, it introduced a way for visitors to Facebook Pages to take various actions, like getting quotes, buying event tickets from Ticketmaster and buying movie tickets, among other things. At the time, the movie ticket sales were being made possible through a partnership with Fandango, and had begun with just a few titles in U.S. theaters, like The Magnificent Seven, Storks and others. The interface for those movie ticket sales from Facebook Pages looks just like the one you’ll see from the Facebook app’s “Movies” section, currently.  That indicates this is more of an expansion of the existing relationship with Fandango, rather than something entirely new to Facebook. That is, instead of having to visit an individual movie’s Facebook Page to start the purchasing process, you can just go to a single destination in the Facebook app. That makes it simpler to see all the movies playing nearby and complete your transaction. For Fandango, its interest in working with Facebook went beyond purchasing ease, Paul Yanover, Fandango’s president, told The New York Times last fall. It was also about the ability to connect groups of friends who would go see movies together.  But for Facebook, the feature is now one of many that have launched in its main navigation in recent months, as the social network is shaping up to become a portal that offers anything you’d need online. In other words, Facebook wants to keep you in its app instead of having you turn to Google, or seek out other mobile apps to perform a task, get information, use a service, etc. For example, the company has added features to its app’s main navigation that include a way to order food delivery; a Town Hall for connecting with local, state and national government representatives; access to your daily weather and forecast; an Explore feed for finding new Facebook Pages you might like; a selection of trending news items; a way to watch the top Live videos; a QR code scanner; a Wi-Fi finder; easier access to Safety Check; a networking-focused “Discover People” section; and many other options. And that’s not the complete list. We understand that the Facebook “Movies” button is considered a test, and has been slowly expanding to users across the U.S. That means some of you will have seen this option long before now, while others are only newly seeing it. It’s very difficult to tell when Facebook actually launches new features, because of how it tests products with small audiences, then larger ones and then sometimes decides to yank the feature or make it publicly available. Movie tickets aren’t the only type of ticket that Facebook is selling these days, we should also note. Its “Marketplace” section is rolling out a “ticket sales” section, too, which allows local event hosts to promote their events inside Facebook’s Craigslist-like feature. Post updated 9/9/17, 9:30 AM ET, as an Atom Tickets integration has now gone live.    \n",

            "129 Facebook plans to spend up to $1B on original shows in 2018\n",
            "Facebook  could spend as much as $1 billion to fund original content initiatives for its new Watch video platform, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. The amount might seem familiar – it’s the same investment Apple is said to have earmarked for original shows and movies through 2018. Facebook’s spend could vary depending on the success of programming, but it’s also a figure that extends through next year. This would also be a new high-water mark for Facebook spending on video content specific for its platform, exceeding past initiatives like incentives paid to encourage live streaming from media outlets. Facebook launched Watch to all U.S. users this week – the new tab in the Facebook app houses original shows from Facebook partners, including content from Freethink Media, MLB, Discovery Channel and more. It’s hoping to drive more engagement on the platform with its original video content initiative, and the shows resemble a lot of the videos that naturally receive a lot of interaction on the platform when shared, covering sports, science and other ‘shareable’ topics. This kind of spending on original content, even if Facebook extends to the top end of its proposed budget, is still behind what dedicated companies like Netflix and Amazon spend on their own shows. But it’s not far off from HBO’s annual content creation spend, and could go a long way if Facebook is spending more of it on less ambitious programming relative to something like Game of Thrones. Streaming platforms so far have shown that destination programming is key – Facebook’s approach seems to be a blend of the Netflix and YouTube methods for obtaining said programming. Next year definitely sounds like it’ll be interesting for the original content realm – should give us plenty to talk about.  \n",

            "130 Facebook is testing features to help you make new friends\n",
            "Facebook  wants to show you more of what you have in common with potential new friends and make sure you don’t forget about your old ones either. The company is rolling out a feature that allows you to get a closer look at your friend’s buddies. It’s not only showcasing connections you’ve yet to make but a lot of current friends as well, which seems a bit odd, but I suppose it helps you orient yourself with friends you haven’t interacted with in a bit. Don’t worry, I charged my phone Once you tap on a button urging you to “get to know [name’s] friends” you’re cast into a carousel of the connections. Previously, the most prominent way Facebook orients you with potential new friends was by showing you your mutual friends. This option digs deeper, showing you events that you both attended, pages you both like, places you’ve both worked or lived. In February, Facebook began rolling out “Discover People,” a feature designed to help you find new connections largely through groups and events. The friend cards are the same here, but this roll out throws them into a more wide feature release. Facebook is also looking to get you closer to some of the friends you already have in the app. Motherboard reports that a new feature is bringing some Tinder-like functionality to Messenger, allowing users to connect if they both indicate that they’re interested in hanging out. It’s also a little reminiscent of some of Snapchat’s efforts to get you to interact with friends you haven’t traded messages with in a while. Having this functionality inside Messenger is, again, a bit of an odd choice given that you’d have to switch to the main app to view a person’s profiles. There doesn’t seem to be any clear “dating app” language present instead it’s more focused on friendly encounters, i.e. “Would you like to meet up with [name] this week?” The changes that would need to be taken to transform this feature into a Tinder or Bumble-like applet don’t take any major mental leaps though and dating could be a huge move for the company in the future. Ultimately, Facebook is better with friends and even if the connection suggestions that Facebook comes up with are already stellar, it’s good to see some of the thinking that’s being done behind the scenes in terms of common interests.    \n",

            "131 Facebook is full of bloatware\n",
            "I’m getting a dark techie feeling lately that I hoped I wouldn’t return to: it’s the sensation I had when I cracked open my new Dell Inspiron laptop in 2005 and was left grappling with all the bloatware already clogging my 60gb hard drive. This time that feeling comes when I open up the Facebook or Messenger apps. There’s honestly just too much stuff, too many unused features, too many new tabs, and all the while feeds are getting clogged by product initiatives Facebook is trying to shove at people. What I once would have described as Facebook being “nimble” in trying a bunch of stuff out and seeing what stuck is now just them chasing their growth demons while failing to combine disparate initiatives in a user-friendly manner. Facebook’s success these days relies on the fact that to many people Facebook is the internet and their platform’s reach means that they can fill their apps to the brim with updates that will likely fail but could maybe, just maybe, tap a massive market. So many other technology startups have to approach feature updates with laser precision, on Facebook that concept matters less because at this point, it’s essentially a public utility. While platforms like Snapchat see each new feature push the boundaries of the app’s overall scope, Facebook is an expansive browser that’s always brainstormin where it can beg, borrow or steal your attention away. The issue is that at a certain point, it’s stealing your attention away from its own initiatives. Recently it feels like Messenger is filled to the brim with so many unrelated expansions that it’s hard to even find where your conversations are on the screen at times. Meanwhile, the main Facebook app seems to constantly be switching my bottom tabs in an attempt to brute force its way past its own insecurities. Marketplace houses commerce ambitions. Watch is a home for original content hopes. Explore is where the site’s media ambitions become more outright. With so much overcompensation, where do my interests fit in? Meanwhile the hamburger button in the main app houses an almost comical amount of feature copies from other tech companies. Facebook doesn’t just connect me with friends, I can find a new job! I can order food! I can clip coupons! I can shop! I can send money! And, thank god, I can scan QR codes! In the midst of this, Instagram has morphed into such an elegant, fine-tuned hub of content creation that it’s so easy to locate Facebook’s own shortcomings in pushing people to keep sharing their own stuff. I’ve seen more feature updates get pushed regarding Live and 360 photo/video than I’ve actually seen friends using them. Facebook and Messenger stories have been ghost feeds because people aren’t using FB the way they once did. Facebook is turning into a more passive web experience and it doesn’t necessarily need you to contribute to thrive anymore, your data is enough. The problem is user-generated content is always something dangerous to minimize in a long-term growth strategy. Even as Snap, Google and Apple are declaring full-court presses on phone-based augmented reality camera feeds, Facebook is pushing ahead as well, but the fact that people aren’t accustomed to taking photos directly within the app will be a daunting challenge for them to overcome. While Snap is “a camera company,” and OS-makers control the stock camera app, FB’s efforts may forever be just another icon holding a hidden feature set. Facebook and Messenger are wildly prevalent apps, but it’s becoming harder and harder to tell what their missions are. Every new feature presents a new opportunity for Facebook to expand its ambitions or get more insights for their advertising engine, but it’s also a chance for me to get fed up by the constant clutter of Facebook’s ambitions.  \n",

            "Facebook  and Microsoft announced ONNX, the Open Neural Network Exchange this morning in respective blog posts. The Exchange makes it easier for machine learning developers to convert models between PyTorch and Caffe2 to reduce the lag time between research and productization. Facebook has long maintained the distinction between its FAIR and AML machine learning groups. Facebook AI Research (FAIR) handles bleeding edge research while Applied Machine Learning (AML) brings intelligence to products. Choice of deep learning framework underlies this key ideological distinction. FAIR is accustomed to working with PyTorch — a deep learning framework optimized for achieving state of the art results in research, regardless of resource constraints. Unfortunately in the real world, most of us are limited by the computational capabilities of our smartphones and computers. When AML wants to build something for deployment and scale, it opts for Caffe2. Caffe2 is also a deep learning framework but it’s optimized for resource efficiency, particularly with respect to Caffe2Go that’s optimized for running machine learning models on underpowered mobile devices. The collaborative work Facebook and Microsoft  are announcing helps folks easily convert models built in PyTorch into Caffe2 models. By reducing the barriers to moving between these two frameworks, the two companies can actually improve the diffusion of research and help speed up the entire commercialization process. Unfortunately not every company uses the same PyTorch and Caffe2 pairing. Plenty of research is still done in TensorFlow and other key frameworks. Outside of a research context, others have been working to make it easier to convert machine learning models into formats optimized for specific devices. Apple’s CoreML for example helps developers convert a very limited number of models. At this point CoreML doesn’t even support TensorFlow and the process of creating custom converters seems quite complicated and likely to end in disappointment. As companies like Google and Apple gain more control over machine learning framework optimization on custom hardware, it’s going to be important to continue to monitor interoperability. The Open Neural Network Exchange has been released on Github, you can find it here.  \n",

            "To boost the popularity of Stories, Facebook  could turn to its photo-centric sister app. In a new feature test first spotted by the Next Web’s Matt Navarra and Twitter user @mruiandre, some users are seeing an option to share Instagram Stories directly to the main Facebook app. Instagram  has since confirmed that the feature is indeed in testing. 🚨 ALERT 🚨Instagram is testing option to share your 'Story' directly to Facebook h/t @mruiandre pic.twitter.com/VTqI92dNJe — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) September 6, 2017  Facebook added its own version of Stories earlier this year, but the feature hasn’t taken off with the same gusto as its Instagram counterpart. The company could solve that problem by mixing Instagram content into Facebook itself, as users seem perfectly happy posting on-the-fly photo and video updates to the photo-sharing app. The move would be an interesting intermixing of content between the two apps, which have remained mostly separate (much to the relief of Instagram loyalists) since Facebook first bought Instagram back in 2012. Instagram users have been able to share individual photo and video posts to their Facebook News Feeds for a long time now, though no content travels the other direction. Instagram Stories already has aggressive placement in its own app, appearing on a separate bar above normal Instagram posts. The company added the Snapchat copycat feature back in August 2016 and the feature’s popularity is likely largely the cause of Snapchat’s slowed growth in 2017. Since that whole Instagram Stories thing appears to be going so well, porting it over into Facebook proper isn’t a bad idea — it’s just another benefit of having a whole suite of apps that you can pick and choose from in order to fine-tune the main money-maker.  \n",

            "134 Facebook sold more than $100,000 in political ads to a Russian company during the 2016 election\n",
            "Following its April post-mortem on its platform’s role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Facebook is out with some juicy new details. Most noteworthy given the public’s intense interest in all things Russian is the fact that potential pro-Kremlin entities apparently purchased as much as $150,000 in political ads on the platform between 2015 and 2017. As Facebook  Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos explained in a blog post: “There have been a lot of questions since the 2016 US election about Russian interference in the electoral process. In April we published a white paper that outlined our understanding of organized attempts to misuse our platform. One question that has emerged is whether there’s a connection between the Russian efforts and ads purchased on Facebook. These are serious claims and we’ve been reviewing a range of activity on our platform to help understand what happened. “In reviewing the ads buys, we have found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June of 2015 to May of 2017 — associated with roughly 3,000 ads — that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia.” In addition to that $100,000, another $50,000 in political ad spending is thought to have loose connections to Russia that suggest Russian origins, including “ads bought from accounts with US IP addresses but with the language set to Russian.” According to Stamos, the “vast majority” of the ads in question did not explicitly mention candidate names or the presidential race itself. Instead, they focused on a spectrum of wedge issues that were particularly hot leading into the election, including gun rights, immigration, LGBT rights and race. Roughly one quarter of these ads were targeted to particular geographic regions, particularly the ads that ran in 2015. Facebook’s more recent findings mesh with the insights around political misinformation campaigns that it published in April of this year. Perhaps most interesting is the revelation that bots aren’t actually responsible for most of this stuff — the bulk of it appears to be non-automated, coordinated campaigns by human actors. Given the deep knowledge of state-level American politics necessary to successfully geo-target ads like these, the whole thing raises further questions about the possibility that entities linked to the Russian government might have coordinated with individuals in the U.S., though it doesn’t begin to answer those questions. On Wednesday, Facebook spoke to Congress about the findings as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. In a follow-up story by The Washington Post, Facebook admitted that “there is evidence that some of the accounts are linked to a troll farm in St. Petersburg, referred to as the Internet Research Agency, though we have no way to independently confirm.” The Internet Research Agency is a group known for its pro-Kremlin online propaganda campaigns, which U.S. intelligence agencies believe is funded by a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin with connections to the Russian intelligence community. For its part, Facebook has been acting on the results of its internal audit examining the ways its platform may have been exploited in the 2016 U.S. election. Based on these reviews, the company was able to boot off its platform 30,000 suspect accounts engaging in what it calls “false amplification” around the time of the French election earlier this year. The company has also begun blocking ads from pages and accounts that repeatedly share fake news and misinformation. Still, if these kind of influence campaigns are truly linked to Russian intelligence efforts, Facebook is going to have a hell of a time trying to stay a few steps ahead.  \n",

            "Today Facebook  officially opened its new Watch tab of original video content to everyone in the U.S. after a limited rollout a month ago and expansion to some more users last week. Available on Facebook’s native mobile apps, desktop site, and TV apps, Watch lets users subscribe to their favorite series instead of just haphazardly stumbling upon one-off videos in the News Feed. U.S. users will now see the TV icon in the mobile navigation bar and desktop site bookmarks. Meanwhile, Facebook is trying to ensure that user generated videos don’t get taken down for including music owned by the major record labels. Bloomberg reports Facebook is offering the labels hundreds of millions of dollars for a deal that would let infringing videos stay up, rather than be removed to the great annoyance of users. Facebook had planned to build out a YouTube Content ID-style system so labels could detect uses of their music and claim a cut of monetization from then instead of just issuing blunt takedown notices. But Bloomberg says that system could take up to two years to build, and Facebook is willing to pay now to stop the takedowns. Facebook is offering a range of different options for discovering video content, including a carousel of featured programs, and sections like “Today’s Spotlight”, “New This Week”, “Popular Now”, “What Friends Are Watching”, “Most Talked About”, “Suggested For You”, and a special “10 Minutes Or More” spot for long-form videos.  For now, Facebook is primarily highlighting reality shows, which partners are producing en masse since they’re cheap, don’t require set scripts, and can be watched piece-meal. But to really seduce audiences who frequent YouTube, Netflix, and cable TV, Facebook will need high quality scripted comedies and dramas. One of the first signs of this content is the sci-fi short film ‘Lost Memories’ by independent filmmaker Francois Ferracci about a future “over-saturated by holograms”. Beyond that, its current offering isn’t very appealing, as the shows lack stars, big budgets, or cliff-hangers. But if you’re the type to just turn on the Discovery Channel and lay back on the couch, you might find some fun time-wasters on Facebook Watch.  \n",

            "Uber  has hired Firefox co-founder Blake Ross  to work with them on product strategy. Ross will be working with the ridesharing company part-time from Los Angeles. He announced it on Facebook,  where he once worked as director of product.  “I’m joining Uber to help develop product strategy, rally the troops, and improve my passenger rating,” quipped Ross. The news comes just two days after the company announced its new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi. The role had been vacant since June, when Travis Kalanick was pressured to resign. From a “#DeleteUber” social media campaign in January to allegations of a sexist company culture to a patent lawsuit with Waymo, it’s been a difficult year for the global ridesharing company. Yet its financials show Uber has still continued to grow. We can expect Uber to make more key hires in the coming months as it tries to improve its image and gear up toward its eventual IPO. As for Ross, it looks like he’ll have more inspiration for his Silicon Valley-themed spoofs.   \n",

            "Facebook  is planning to open source LogDevice, the company’s custom-built solution for storing logs collected from distributed data centers. The company made the announcement as part of its Scale conference. Logs are used to track database events. If a server suffers an outage for any reason, companies need a way to debug, perform security audits and ensure consistency between servers. This is particularly important to Facebook, which holds immense amounts of your content across its massive data centers around the world. LogDevice is capable of recording data regardless of hardware or network issues. If something breaks, it will simply hand-off the task of collecting logs. And when everything turns back on, LogDevice can restore records at between five and 10 gigabytes per second. If you’re Facebook, and will soon have 10 data centers, you need a system of record to ensure each center is on the same page. And things get extra complicated when you consider the complexity of backups the company needs to do with its data. LogDevice helps when you need to replicate data from these separate data centers. If you get frustrated and regretfully throw an expensive server across the room, LogDevice will report exactly which records were lost. By separating record sequencing and storage, and randomly assigning records to different storage locations, it enhances resiliency of the entire data center. Facebook didn’t give an exact date for when it expects to open source LogDevice, but it says it will occur later in 2017.  \n",

            "As part of its Scale conference today in San Jose, Facebook’s  computational photography team is announcing the completion of an internal research project dedicated to helping you clean up your poorly taken 360 photos. The team used a deep neural network to identify crooked 360 photos and reorient them to maintain realism. You’ve probably used leveling tools before on your smartphone to salvage pictures taken at awkward angles. But Matt Uyttendaele, one of the research scientists working on the project, explained to me in an interview that traditional computer vision researchers would approach this problem by looking to identify straight lines in a photo converging at a vanishing point (when two parallel lines appear to intersect). But this approach isn’t super generalizable because a lot of photos simply don’t have enough parallel lines to act as reference points. So instead, Uyttendaele and his team trained up a neural net, specifically AlexNet, on rotated images labeled with tilt and roll values. It turned out that having enough of this data was actually one of the biggest challenges of the entire effort. Once the team cobbled together 500,000 non-rotated images, they artificially rotated them. This yielded a nice data set to build a model for 360 image correction. The feature hasn’t been deployed yet, but it’s expected that this should happen in the coming months once product decisions have been made as to how users will opt-in to the corrective capability and testing is complete.  \n",

            "As Tropical Storm Harvey continues to inundate the Texas Gulf Coast, Facebook users have one more reason to donate to relief efforts. Facebook  announced Tuesday that it would match the Harvey disaster relief funds raised by its users up to $1 million. To contribute match-eligible funds to Harvey recovery efforts on the platform, Facebook users can follow the message on top of their News Feed urging them to donate or they can donate directly through the center for Disaster Philanthropy’s Facebook page. Over the years, Facebook has increasingly positioned itself as a tool for both fundraising and for connecting friends and loved ones in times of crisis. In June, Facebook announced that its Safety Check feature — a tool for users to mark themselves as “safe” during emergencies and natural disasters — would integrate support for crisis-specific fundraising.

            "Facebook  says it’s taking another step against Pages that share fabricated news stories. The company has already been working with outside fact-checkers like Snopes and the AP to flag inaccurate news stories. (These aren’t supposed to be stories that are disputed for reasons of opinion or partisanship, but rather outright hoaxes and lies.) It also says that when a story is marked as disputed, the link can can no longer be promoted through Facebook ads. The next step, which the company is announcing today, involves stopping Pages that regularly share these stories from buying any Facebook ads at all, regardless of whether or not the ad includes a disputed link. Facebook was criticized last year for its role in helping to spread of fake/false news. (The company is using the term “false news” for now — “fake news” has become heavily politicized and almost meaningless.) Product Director Rob Leathern said the company has been trying to fight back in three ways — ending the economic incentive to post false news stories, slowing the spread of those stories and helping people make more informed decisions when they see a false story. In this case, Leathern said blocking ad-buying is meant to change the economic incentives. Facebook is concerned that “there are Pages posting this information that are using Facebook Ads to build audiences” to spread false news. By changing the ad policy, Facebook makes it harder for companies to attract that audience. Facebook isn’t specifying the exact numbers of disputed links a Page can share before it gets blocked — after all, the company doesn’t want people to try to game the system — but Leathern said, “Obviously, it’s not a single instance. It’s a repeated pattern of misinformation.” He also noted that the ban on buying ads isn’t necessarily permanent. If a Page stops sharing false stories, it should eventually be able to buy ads again.  \n",

            "Facebook  says it’s looking to become more open and transparent about its decisions, and it’s hired Liz Spayd, a former public editor of The New York Times, to consult on the process. The hire comes as Facebook — or at least, parts of Facebook — seems to be wrestling with its role in the public sphere. There have been specific controversies, like the debate over Facebook’s role in spreading fake news (which the company has been doing more to fight), as well as a broader conversation around what responsibility Facebook has toward its 2 billion users. One of the ways Facebook has tried to open up about these issues is through a series of blog posts around “Hard Questions,” like how Facebook addresses hate speech and what happens to people’s profiles after they die. These posts are usually written by Facebook employees, but a spokesperson told me Spayd has been working for the past few weeks to help with Hard Questions and potentially to bring that same approach to transparency to other parts of the company. In some ways, Spayd might seem perfect for that role — as The Times’ public editor,  she served as a sort of intermediary between readers and the newsroom. However, her columns were often controversial. Slate’s Will Oremus probably did the best job of laying out the case against her, arguing that she was “squandering the most important watchdog job in journalism” by parroting journalistic platitudes and reader complaints without thoughtful analysis. Spayd turned out to be the last public editor at The Times, at least for now — the position was eliminated as part of larger editorial cuts. Beyond her work as public editor, Spayd has a long journalistic résumé, including serving as editor of the Columbia Journalism Review and managing editor of the Washington Post. Her hiring was first reported by Recode.  \n",

            "144 Facebook adds new ways to revisit your memories and milestones\n",
            "Facebook  today is expanding on the popularity of its two-year old “On This Day” sharing prompt, with the addition of new features that let users revisit their memories, as well as celebrate milestones related to their friendships on the social network. While “On This Day” provides a look back in time, starting with memories from the same day last year, two new options will instead focus on your more recent memories. The company will now begin to bundle your past posts into monthly or seasonal sharing prompts. For example, you might see recap stories for things like your summer memories or your January memories. Like “On This Day,” these new sharing prompts are private to you, unless you choose to post them to your Facebook profile. They’ll also appear in your News Feed, where you’ll see the collection of photos Facebook has picked for you along with the “Share” button below. The recap feature arrives at a time when Facebook is struggling with consumer adoption of its Snapchat Stories clone, which unlike Instagram Stories, has not taken off. Facebook even began showing grayed-out images of friends’ photos earlier this year in Stories, in an effort to increase usage. Facebook believes that Stories is simply a new sharing format that every network will eventually offer. However, many people think of Facebook as a more permanent record of life events, thanks to its ability surface old memories, search or scroll back through timelines to see historic personal moments, like the date you got married, started a new job, moved to a new home, and so on. That’s why a recap feature makes more sense for Facebook, as opposed to the recency associated with Stories. It’s a better fit for a network that’s encouraged people from day one to document what matters in their lives, not what’s disposable.  In addition to this, Facebook is also today launching new friendship milestones. While the social network already allows users to celebrate their friendship anniversaries on Facebook with playful posts and videos, these new moments will focus on notable achievements – like when the number of friends you have hits a nice, round number like 100, or when your posts have been liked 1,000 times, for instance. These messages are shown only to you, and are oddly not shareable at launch. However, Facebook says that will change in the future. Meanwhile, “On this Day” is now finally available to all on Facebook, the company also says. Facebook has improved its filtering process to keep those memories associated with negative events or feelings from popping up in its suggestions, it notes.  Features like these are minor updates in the grand scheme of things, but they have a larger goal: to keep users posting to Facebook. Last year, there were reports detailing how Facebook sharing – specifically “organic sharing,” meaning personal updates –  was in decline. Since then, Facebook has made a number of changes to make sharing and participating more engaging, as with the rollout of colored backgrounds for status updates, support for GIFs in comments, among other things. Facebook says the new features are rolling out now, and will be expanded to include more prompts in the months ahead.  \n",

            "Facebook  is faced with yet another content-related scandal, after The Times newspaper reported that people traffickers and slave traders are using its platform to broadcast videos of migrants being tortured to try to extort money from their families. According to the newspaper’s report, footage showing Libyan gangmasters threatening the lives of migrants had remained on the social network for months. It reports that harrowing footage shared on Facebook showed emaciated and injured migrants, mostly Somalis and Ethiopians, huddled in a concrete cellar describing the abuse they have suffered and pleading for their lives. The Times quotes a United Nations migration agency criticizing the company for allowing people traffickers to use its site to “advertise their services, entice vulnerable people on the move and then exploit them and their families”. Mohammed Abdiker, of the International Organisation for Migration, said: “It is irresponsible for tech companies like Facebook to ignore this issue. It’s hard to believe that the tech giants cannot put some real effort into stopping these smugglers from using their platforms for racketeering.” In one instance the newspaper says a video that had been posted on June 9 was still on the site until yesterday. Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch it had removed some of the content after the Times reported it. In a statement, a spokesperson told us: “Offering services to take part in, support or promote people smuggling on Facebook, violates our Community Standards.” In an earlier statement to the Times, it added: “People smuggling is illegal and any posts, pages or groups that co-ordinate this activity are not allowed on Facebook. We encourage people to keep using our reporting tools to flag this kind of behaviour so it can be reviewed and swiftly removed by our global team of experts, who work with law enforcement agencies around the world.” A series of public outcries over content moderation has cranked up the political pressure on Facebook in recent times — ranging from suicides and murders being broadcast via its live streaming service, to extremist propaganda and child abuse content. It also faces ongoing pressure to speed up hate speech take downs — especially in Europe, where legislators are eyeing fines to enforce action. In May, faced with rising political pressure on multiple fronts, Facebook announced it would be adding 3,000 additional staff to its content moderation team — expanding it to 7,500. Although for a platform with two billion users globally that’s clearly a drop in the ocean. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also said it’s hope is that developments in AI technology will enable it to automate content moderation at scale in time. Though he also warned such a scenario is likely years out — meanwhile the scandals keep coming. Including, now, an accusation that it is not doing enough to stop people traffickers utilizing its platform to profit from human misery. The company argues it seeks to balance raising awareness of controversial issues, including from war zones, with taking down content that may be disturbing to users. A spokesman told us that in this instance, for example, while it has removed abuse videos reported to it by the Times, it has not removed a video report by a Somali journalist covering people smuggling, although it has added a warning to flag the disturbing nature of the content. “We also believe it is important that Facebook continues to be a place where people can raise awareness of important, and sometimes controversial issues. This specific video was posted to condemn the content, so we would not consider it a violation of our policies. However, the content is alarming, and we have marked the video as disturbing. This means there will be a warning screen and the video’s distribution will be limited to those aged 18 and over,” the spokesperson added.  \n",

            "Adding real-world diversity to emoji is a work in progress, but with platforms spanning the entire globe, it’s clearly important to big companies like Facebook . The social network just rolled out a set of new “family” emoji that, while they don’t yet capture the full spectrum, at least let your partner and kids have something other than yellow skin. It’s live right now in the desktop and mobile site — but not Messenger, which for some reason uses different emoji, or the mobile app. All you have to do is pull down the emoji menu, then do a long click on the family emoji — your options should appear above the default yellow-skinned emoji. So why did this take so long? Well, standards take a while to set, and the UTF standard for modifying the skin color of emoji had to be developed and agreed upon. And once that happens, it’s up to platforms how they want to implement that standard. In this case, it was Microsoft that jumped on the possibility of diverse family emoji first — more than a year ago. But see if you can spot the difference between the ones above and Microsoft’s: Yeah — diversity is complicated! Families frequently aren’t all black, all brown, or all yellow. Reflecting real diversity in families is different from doing so with individuals. And the encoding process is different, too. Normally you have the emoji (👩‍🚀) and a skin tone (🏽) joined by a special character that tells the system to combine them, producing an emoji with that skin tone (👩🏽‍🚀). But families aren’t so easily encoded, so to speak. What if you have an hispanic man who has married a black woman, and they have a son with lighter skin and a daughter who favors her mother? Turns out there are 52,000 options for combining the different genders and colors. There’s an existing code grammar for this, but it isn’t well supported — if you saw one of their complex families on other platforms, it wouldn’t render properly. Instead it shows as a sequence of each person in the family — actually a rather graceful failure. Anyway, back to Facebook. They’re all about ease of use, and having 52,000 options pop up in the emoji menu isn’t a good user experience. So for now the social network opted to keep things monochrome in a fashion, though less monochrome than they were before. Yellow faces may be a decent alternative for people whose skin tone actually resembles it, but people with darker skin will surely appreciate this option, even if it isn’t comprehensive yet. I’ve asked Facebook if it plans to add multi-tone families any time soon, and I’ll update this if I hear back.  \n",

            "Veteran Facebook  exec Andrew “Boz” Bosworth is taking over consumer hardware efforts at the company, including projects under groups like Building 8 and Oculus. The announcement was made internally by Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer, Business Insider reports. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the appointment to TechCrunch. Bosworth, who joined Facebook in January of 2006, has been instrumental to a number of core product features, including perhaps most notably, the News Feed. He has most recently served as the company’s VP of ads and business platform. Long-time Facebook ads engineering head Mark Rabkin will be taking over Bosworth’s ad responsibilities as he shifts to hardware. This move comes following a number of leaks which have detailed some of the efforts being made to move the internet company into consumer hardware products, including a video chat device and a dedicated smart speaker. The new report sheds some light on the video chat device specifically, codenamed “Aloha,” which will reportedly feature a large touch screen and function similarly to Amazon’s Echo Show. The device may use facial detection to recognize people participating in video calls and will reportedly cost around $499, though pricing has not been finalized. The company may also be working on its own consumer 360-degree camera as well as a “necklace embedded with sensors,” according to the report. Oculus,  which sells virtual reality hardware and is currently working on augmented reality products, will also be under Bosworth’s jurisdiction. “We are excited about our long-term investments in virtual reality, augmented reality, and consumer hardware,” a company spokesperson said in a statement given to TechCrunch. “We believe these new technologies have the potential to bring the world closer together in entirely new ways, and we’ve built great teams with strong leadership in each of these areas. Bringing these teams closer together will help us move even faster as we continue to invest in our 10-year roadmap.” BI’s report notes that Facebook’s ex-Xiaomi VP of VR Hugo Barra and Building 8’s ex-DARPA Regina Dugan will both report to Bosworth.  \n",

The deal will bring 15 live college football games to Facebook, including nine Conference USA games and six Mountain West games. These games will be exclusively broadcast on Facebook, the company says, and will be available on the Stadium: Live College Football Show Page to users worldwide, as well as on Watch for U.S. users. Unlike games aired on traditional television, the games broadcast on Facebook will take advantage of the digital platform to introduce a number of interactive elements as part of the viewing experience. For example, they will include a live, curated chat from football personalities alongside the on-air presentation. Plus, a social team and other correspondents will work to engage the at-home audience in conversation.

Facebook, meanwhile, this year partnered with Fox for rights to stream Champions League soccer, and with the MLB to live stream regular season games. The college football games will kick off on Saturday, September 2nd with Miami Ohio at Marshall and UC Davis at San Diego State. The full schedule is below: Facebook will not disclose how much it paid for the exclusive rights to stream these games, but is “investing in the content,” according to a Facebook spokesperson.

After looking into Amazon, Microsoft and Google, we’re peeking at Facebook.  Living in the post-Snap IPO era as we now are, it’s a great moment to look back at Facebook’s public offerings.

So let’s rewind the clock and take a look at Facebook’s IPO. Facebook’s first S-1 is dated February 1st, 2012. Its final S-1/A was filed May 16th of the same year. The firm went public two days later on the 18th. In the end, Facebook settled on a $38 per-share price after a positive pricing cycle. As Forbes noted on May 17th, 2012, the company both raised its price above range and threw in more shares: Facebook priced at the top of its $34 to $38 per share range, showing the strong investor demand for the stock. This week Facebook raised the price range of the offering from a range of $28 to $35. Then the company increased the size of the offering from selling shareholders. The Menlo Park, Calif. company is selling 421 million shares, 180 million from the company and 241 million from selling stockholders. You can quickly do the math yourself: $38 per share times 421 million shares works out to a smidge under $16 billion — an incredible IPO sum. However, the firm only collected a portion of that total, as the final clause in our quote notes. The company’s 180 million shares worked out to a smaller $6.8 billion sum. Still, the aggregate value of shares sold in its IPO was staggering, as was the valuation Facebook settled on: $104 billion. Media coverage wasn’t kind at the time to the figure, despite investors being willing to buy the company’s shares at the price. The Verge, for example, dished the following: “Can Facebook live up to its $104 billion valuation?”  The article also featured the following URL slug: “facebook-ipo-peaked-overpriced-stock.” That’s plain enough. Around the same time, TechCrunch, noting that Facebook’s IPO was the “third largest IPO in U.S. history,” argued that the social company’s rich valuation implied that the firm would “likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation.” How fair was that skepticism? Let’s find out by looking at Facebook’s then-current financial performance. For our work today, we will employ Facebook’s final S-1/A document. It includes the company’s Q1 2012 results that were unfinished in its earlier filings. What is immediately remarkable about Facebook is that, unlike nearly every technology company pursuing an IPO today, it sported both revenue growth and rising profits. (So far, only one of the four companies in the Big 5 that we have examined was a money-loser at the time of its IPO. And the exception is Amazon, which remains an exception to this day.) In fact, observe the following chart showing Facebook’s remarkable trailing quarterly results:  (Drilling a bit further, Facebook had very little share-based expense in the then-year-ago first quarter [2011]. Deduct that cost from the company’s 2012 first quarter and its profit rose, in case you noticed the year-over-year profit results and found them wanting.) Regardless, Facebook was going public with a history of revenue growth, GAAP (meaning inclusive of all annoying costs) profits and its first seasonal decline in revenue that we can see. Dialing back a bit, from 2010’s fourth quarter to its first quarter in 2011, Facebook’s revenue stayed flat, implying that it managed to meet its holiday-bolstered quarter in the following period through sheer growth. From 2011’s holiday cycle to 2012’s opening three months, Facebook shrunk. We care about Facebook’s first seasonal slip as Snap, our modern comp of sorts for Facebook’s IPO days, saw seasonal declines in its revenue far earlier in its growth curve. Snap is barely over the $150 million-per-quarter revenue milestone and saw seasonality-induced revenue declines in its first quarter. Facebook was multiples larger before it had the same issue; how bullish that was for Facebook, or how bearish today’s situation should be for Snap, is up to you. Returning to our question of how fair media skepticism was for Facebook’s IPO, let’s again read The Verge and TechCrunch. First, The Verge, from its Facebook IPO coverage: When you compare Facebook to other public tech companies, its valuation also looks way out of whack. The company earned around $1 billion last year, which means its price to earnings ratio, a common method for evaluating stocks, is roughly 100 to 1. Google currently trades around 20 to 1 and Apple, far and away the most profitable tech company of our times, is trading around 16 to 1. And TechCrunch made the same point: “A $104 billion market capitalization puts Facebook at more than 100 times its trailing earnings.” In short, both publications harped on Facebook for being expensive on a price-earnings basis when compared to its already public rivals. This is notable for a couple of reasons when we stack 2012 against the current market: The market was therefore very different in 2012 than it is today — something I think that we forget. Reading through coverage of Facebook’s IPO, it’s obvious that Snap would not have been able to go public in 2012. The market would not have tolerated something so unprofitable to sport a sky-high valuation so close to the 2008 recession. There simply wasn’t the same appetite for risk. So Facebook had to go public under stricter rules. That isn’t some sort of punishment, per se, but that market condition as at the time did Facebook in the ass eventually: Despite putting up $1 billion in trailing profit, Facebook was in for a rough ride after its shares started to trade. Returning to our chewing of contemporary media reports, here’s TechCrunch’s coverage of Facebook’s results just over 10 days following its IPO: “Facebook Has Lost About $35 Billion In Value Since IPO As Shares Dip Below $29.” The company went public at $38, as you recall. The company’s ensuing share-price declines led to a dramatic spurt of negative coverage of the company. Headlines like “Embittered Facebook investors ponder next move” came out as Facebook’s share price continued to fall. Facebook didn’t stop deflating until it slipped under the $18 per-share mark. It was a staggering reversal of trend. Recall that Facebook raised its IPO price range before pricing at the very upper-end. The fall from $38 to $18, for example, is just over 50 percent. Of course, the time in purgatory didn’t last forever. In mid-2013, Facebook shares perked up following its second-quarter earnings results and never looked back, at least as of the time of writing. What went wrong for Facebook and what eventually went right for the company have the same answer: mobile; if Facebook was going to manage a switch to the mobile world was, for some time, an open question. Investors were worried, and fear leads to a lower share price. And so when Facebook answered the mobile question, that same fear was mitigated. And its share price recovered. Before we go, let’s remind ourselves of what happened in that critical 2013 spring quarter. If you will allow the self-quote from my coverage of Facebook’s Q2 2012 earnings for TechCrunch: Mobile income as a percentage of ad revenue totaled 41 percent, up 11 percent from the preceding quarter, when it totaled 30 percent. In the final quarter of 2012, mobile ad income was but 24 percent of the total advertising top line. Facebook has proven that it can monetize its growing mobile usage in a big way. Investors will be satiated in that concern. Facebook later noted that mobile revenue will soon outstrip desktop incomes. The company also reaffirmed that Instagram will monetize in the future, largely through advertisements. Frankly, in my view the 41% figure is quite impressive and unexpectedly strong. However, we should not take as indicative that all desktop Internet giants will be able to monetize at similar levels in mobile settings. Facebook data on its users is nearly without compare, and likely provides it with a key competitive advantage in how it can deliver targeted ads to users on the go. There are two takeaways from this coverage: It seems that investors, at that juncture, bought that Facebook was going to do well in a mobile world (Instagram aside). They were right, of course. The company crested its IPO price following that earnings release. Today it trades for more than $167 per share. The company is still profitable, still growing and can claim the mantle of mobile-first. So much for its post-IPO chop. Tying this up neatly, what can we apply from the Facebook lesson to Snap? Nothing. Snap still loses so much money to compare the firms past our superficial alignment would be silly. GAAP profits are an anagram for “the ability to control your own destiny.” On that front, Snap has a long way to go. Homework: How well did Microsoft do with its Facebook investment at a $15 billion valuation. This will help.  \n",

            "151 Teens favoring Snapchat and Instagram over Facebook, says eMarketer\n",
            "Facebook is losing appeal among teens and young adults which is contributing to generally slowing growth for the platform, according to the latest projections from research firm eMarketer. At the same time alternative social apps Snapchat and (Facebook-owned) Instagram are seeing rising and double-digit growth in the same youth demographic — suggesting younger users are favoring newer and more visual communications platforms. “Both platforms have found success with this demographic since they are more aligned with how they communicate — using visual content,” noted eMarketer forecasting analyst Oscar Orozco in a statement. It’s the second consecutive year of expected usage declines for Facebook among this advertiser-coveted group, according to the researcher. eMarketer  suggests some tweens are even skipping adopting Facebook entirely (it calls them “Facebook nevers”) and going straight to the rival platforms, even as remaining tweens and teens appear less engaged on Facebook — logging in less frequently and spending less time on the platform. While having slipping relevance among a coveted ad demographic is obviously not good news for a social behemoth whose business is dependent on ad revenue, Facebook does have the consolation of also owning one of the two main youth-friendly alternative platforms: Instagram . (Aka, ‘if you can’t be it, buy it’.) Still, eMarketer is also projecting that the acquisition that got away from Zuck, Snapchat, will overtake Instagram and Facebook in the total teen (12 to 17) & young adult (18 to 24) ages for the first time in 2017 — boosting its share of US social network users to 40.8 per cent, and projected to push close to a majority by 2021. (Though Instagram is also forecast to maintain its greater reach through this timeframe.) Back in 2013, when reports of Facebook’s spurned acquisition attempts of Snapchat surfaced, it followed fast on the heels of the company reporting a first-time decline in young teens using its service daily. Nearly four years later Facebook’s problem with keeping teens happy has only got bigger — but the company’s success at using Instagram to successfully clone Snapchat’s features has helped mitigate the issue. (Even if it means Facebook’s corporate motto should really now read: ‘Move fast and clone things’.) eMarketer couched U.S. Facebook usage in the 12 and 17 age-group as dropping the most “precipitously” — noting that while 81.9% of social network users in that age range are projected to use Facebook this year, the figure will slide to 76.2% by 2021. Other highlights from eMarketer’s forecast:   eMarketer’s methodology counts a monthly user as someone who is accessing their account at least once per month, consistently, each month throughout the calendar year. It says it bases its forecasts on analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from research firms, government agencies, media firms and public companies, along with interviews with senior execs at publishers, ad buyers and agencies. At the time of writing Facebook had not responded to a request for comment.  \n",

            "152 Facebook’s Safety Check feature gets its own dedicated button, can be accessed anytime\n",
            "Facebook  is giving its “Safety Check” feature a permanent home in its app and on the desktop, the company announced today. The feature, which lets you check to see whether friends and family are safe following a crisis, will now have its own dedicated button in the app’s navigation menu and will be available via the Facebook website on the desktop. The change comes following new terrorist attacks, including one in Barcelona, where a vehicle was driven into a crowd, as well as the attack in Charlottesville, here in the U.S. According to Facebook, the dedicated button is gradually rolling out to users starting today, and will complete over the upcoming weeks. That means you may not see the option right away, but likely will soon. Safety Check has been given increased attention this year, with a series of updates that have included additions like a “Community Help” option that allows locals to offer assistance and supplies to affected people following a crisis or disaster. In June, Safety Check integrated fundraisers, as well. This arrived along with other upgrades like crisis descriptions to help people better understand the situation, and new sharing options that let people tell their own stories, rather than just marking themselves as “safe.” When Safety Check is accessed by way of the new button, you’ll be able to view a feed of disasters, updates from friends who marked themselves as safe and offers of help. An “around the world” section will display where Safety Check has been recently enabled, too. Safety Check has faced some criticism due to its overreach, at times. That is, people are often alerted to tragedies that are taking place miles away, or even further, from their current location. This in turn creates additional stress from a feature whose original purpose was to reduce it. Giving the feature a permanent spot may not improve matters on that front, as it will now always be accessible.  \n",

            "Just as reality appears to be getting worse by the day, VR companies are doing the lord’s work and making the price of escaping it a bit more accessible. HTC is dropping the price of its Vive virtual reality system from $799 to $599 as the Taiwanese tech giant seeks to compete with aggressive price cuts coming from Facebook-owned Oculus  and their Rift headset. At the beginning of the 2017 calendar year, both Oculus and HTC were selling their flagship VR headsets and motion controllers for roughly $800, but a pair of deep price cuts and a temporary summer sale has left the price of the Oculus Rift at $399, nearly half of its original sticker price. Once Oculus’s summer-long sale on its headset ends, the Rift will retail for $499, notably still $100 cheaper than the Vive’s updated pricing. Though HTC fancies the Vive a more premium experience than the Rift, the two are really on mostly equal footing from a hardware standpoint with each having some marginal advantages over the other. For HTC, the task of defending a price tag double its competitor’s has been one in honing its brand messaging in the face of a massive price differential. Just this past March, HTC exec Patrick Seybold said that the company would not be lowering the price of the headset. “We don’t feel the need to cut the price of Vive, as we’ve had incredible success, and continue to see great momentum in market,” he said. Nevertheless, HTC executives insist that today’s $200 drop was one planned long before Oculus dramatically slashed the price of its own system. All is fair in PR and war, but over the past several months it’s become clear that the war is no longer HTC and Oculus trying to discover who is Betamax and who is VHS, now they’re just trying to ensure that high-end VR doesn’t turn out to be LaserDisc. Though few of the big players are keen to readily admit it, many investors and analysts have been less than thrilled with the pace of headset sales over the past year. The problem really doesn’t seem to be so much the headset price as it is the need to buy a powerful desktop PC which retail for around $700+. Though both are working on all-in-one headsets which don’t require a smartphone or PC to operate, it’s unclear how wide the gap in quality will be between the new headsets and their PC-powered older brothers. HTC has dedicated efforts over the past year to ensure that users can have a more modular approach to upgrades on the Vive which really have made having a lower base price a necessity. The company has introduced an integrated audio head strap and has been working with partners to bring technologies like eye-tracking and wireless-streaming to the headset through add-ons. The company will soon have even more competition as Microsoft begins selling “Mixed Reality” headsets from various hardware manufacturers over the holidays and sets sights on a wireless VR headset for its upcoming Xbox One X.  \n",

            "Should your parents be able to read your Facebook  messages if you die? Facebook explained why it won’t let them in a post in its Hard Questions series today about social networking after death. Facebook admits it doesn’t have all the answers, but it has come up with some decent solutions to some issues with what it calls Memorialized Profiles and a “Legacy Contact.” When you pass away, once Facebook is informed, the word “Remembering” appears above your name on your profile and no one else can sign in to your account.  The Legacy Contact is a friend you select in your Manage Account Settings while you’re still alive, though they’re not informed until your profile is memorialized. They can pin a post atop your profile, change your profile pic, respond to friend requests or have your account removed. But Facebook explains they can’t log into your account, change or delete old posts, remove friends or read your messages. Similarly, Facebook won’t allow parents or anyone else to read your messages after you die. That’s because “In a private conversation between two people, we assume that both people intended the messages to remain private,” writes Monika Bickert, Facebook’s Director of Global Policy Management. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act and Stored Communications Act may also prohibit it from sharing private communications even with parental consent. Facebook also tries to minimize the emotional impact of losing a loved one by no longer sending birthday reminders about writing on their wall. But there are still plenty of opportunities for hurt feelings. Facebook’s On This Day feature and others can surface old content from when that person was still alive, creating an unexpected experience of having to think about their death.  The company has built features to enhance empathy with its users, allowing them to avoid unnecessarily seeing their exes on the app after a break-up. But it’s tough to know what will be a sweet nostalgic reminder and what will be a heart-wrenching spiral into the past. What’s important is that Facebook is at least thinking and talking about these issues. Now at 2 billion users, Facebook has become a ubiquitous utility that impacts every phase of our lives. “There’s a deep sense of responsibility in every part of the company,” says Facebook CPO Chris Cox. “We’re getting to the scale where we have to get much better about understanding how the product has been used.”  \n",

            "155 Facebook downranks video clickbait and fake play buttons\n",
            "Ever gotten tricked into clicking a fake play button on Facebook  that opens a link instead of starting a video? I did, repeatedly, and wrote a story in 2014 titled “Yo Facebook, Ban Links With Fake Video Play Buttons”. Now Facebook is doing just that. Today it started downranking the News Feed presence of links that display a fake play button in the preview image, as well as videos that are actually just a static image uploaded as a video file. Publishers who use these scammy tactics will see a major decrease in the distribution of these stories. Facebook won’t completely delete these posts, though, unless they violate its other policies. Here are two examples of fake play buttons that spammers used to steal your clicks:  Facebook has prohibited the use of fake play buttons in advertisements under its policy against depicting non-existent functionality for a few years, News Feed Product Manager Greg Marra tells me. But the scourage has remained in the News Feed. “We’ve heard from people who are frustrated by fake play buttons” Marra says, hence today’s update. “Spammers are using these tactics to trick people into clicking links to low quality web pages.Facebook tells me its now training its machine vision artificial intelligence to classify and detect fake play buttons in preview images. “While the prevalence is statistically low, the frustration expressed by people who use Facebook who encounter these deceptive practices is high” a spokesperson tells me. Facebook says that if publishers want to denote there’s a video behind a link, they should indicate that through Open Graph meta tags. They could also use words like “Watch” or “Video” in the headline or description.   Fake video play buttons in News Feed link previews like the one on the left can mislead people into clicking out to ad-covered sites as shown on the right. Facebook has had a similar problem with publishers looping pre-recorded videos and calling them live, or just putting up a computer graphic countdown and calling it Live. TechCrunch called on Facebook to ban these shenanigans back in January, and it cracked down on them in May. There’s also been the issue of publishers putting fake Instant Articles “Lightning Bolt” icons on the preview images of links to non-Instant Articles on the standard web. That’s because people are more likely to click Instant Articles since they load faster. Meanwhile, Facebook’s emphasis on video in News Feed has inspired the new menace of publishers uploading a static image as a video to get more eyeballs. These static image videos will be downranked too. Facebook is using a “motion scoring” system that detects movement inside a video to classify and demote these clips.  Today’s changes come as part of a massive, multi-pronged atack on clickbait. Facebook now downranks headlines that are misleading or withhold information in many languages, shows fewer links overshared by spammers, works with outside fact checkers to demote false news, promotes iand now shows Related Articles with different angles to make people suspicious of exaggerated clickbait. With each of these updates, Facebook chips away at the clickbait problem, leaving more room in the News Feed for legitimate content. Getting burned by trying to watch a video which is just endless minutes of the same image erodes trust in the News Feed, making people less likely to watch videos in the future. By excising these annoying experiences, users may be willing to browse longer, view more videos from friends and publishers, and watch lucrative video ads that fund Facebook’s soaring profits.  \n",

            "Roughly 1 in 30 Facebook  users tells someone Happy Birthday each day, showing Facebook’s first major emergent behavior is still going strong. Now Facebook is equipping the 45 million people sending birthday wishes each day with some new features. Now instead of just posting a soulless “HBD” or “Happy Birthday!” on someone’s wall with no personal message, photo, memory, or anything that makes it feel sincere, you can post one of Facebook’s auto-generated, personalized birthday videos. Similar to the ones it shows on your friendversary with different people, the birthday video will show photos of you and the birthday boy/girl with stylized transitions. These videos could make it just as easy to send something that shows you and a friend’s unique journey through life together as it does to send a generic string of text. That could make sending birthday wishes feel more authentic and valuable, and less like a boring chore. Facebook launched birthday message recap videos last year to aggregate text wall posts from all your friends into something more visual, but now each friend can send a happy birthday video.  And now when it’s your birthday, you can easily dedicate it to a charity. Two weeks before your birthday, you’ll get a prompt to choose from one of 750,000 eligible non-profits vetted by Facebook. Friends will get a notification about your fundraiser, and be able to donate on your behalf as a birthday gift. Facebook launched the donate button in 2013, and last year let people easily set up personal fundraisers. Facebook has received some flack for charging a 6.9% + $0.30 fee, but that covers processing, security, fraud, and vetting to ensure people are giving to real charities. Facebook has told me this is not a revenue generator, and in fact its fees are lower than what other donation platforms like GoFundMe charge.  Last year Facebook said 100 million birthday wishes per day total. Birthday fundraisers could let people leverage the social obligation some users feel about sending birthday wishes, and turn that sentiment into actual good. It’s nice to see Facebook realize it’s created the “HBD” behavioral norm that wasn’t necessarily delivering much positive outcome or emotional resonance, and turn it into something more beneficial and nostalgia-inducing.  \n",

            "Taking inspiration from line drawings, Reddit and Messenger,  Facebook is overhauling the design of the News Feed to make it more legible, clickable and commentable. Specifically, Facebook now makes it much clearer where threads start and end in comments. Meanwhile, Instagram today got a little redesign itself with comment reels now being threaded so you can have sub-conversations in public.  Facebook periodically updates its design, typically stripping out unnecessary “chrome,” or user interface framing, to create a sleeker, more readable look. There’s more and more white space on Facebook, which could be intended to reduce eye fatigue during long browsing sessions and let your friends’ content pop off the screen more vividly. Facebook’s design team writes “we did not want to just ‘fiddle at the edges’, but rather make something that billions of people use every day less frustrating.” Both the Facebook and Instagram  changes will roll out to all iOS and Android users over the next few weeks.    Facebook is adopting the Messenger bubble style for comments. This will make threading more obvious, but also encourage the rapid-fire conversations people typically have in private messages. Facebook has been trying to make comments feel more alive recently with fast-moving conversations becoming their own chat windows.  Facebook has made its navigation and feedback buttons bigger and easier to recognize with a new unfilled line drawing style. The News Feed, Video, Marketplace, Like, Comment and Share buttons now all feature this look. Meanwhile, Facebook is swapping the classic globe notifications icon for a more standard alerts bell. These could all be less distracting to the eye so you focus on Facebook’s content, not its chrome.  Other redesigns for legibility include higher contrast text that’s easier to see and circular profile photos that take up less space and feel more human. Link previews are now a little bigger, too, which could get more people clicking and sending referral traffic to other sites. However, Facebook says today’s changes shouldn’t impact the reach or traffic of Pages. The URL domain is now more prominent, appearing above the link’s headline, which could reduce the likelihood that users click fake/hoax sites that mimic popular news publisher URLs.  Facebook wants to make sure you don’t get lost several layers deep beyond the feed. Now you’ll see a more obvious header with a bigger black back button when you dive into a post from the News Feed. Facebook also says you’ll be able to “See where a link will take you before clicking on it,” though it already had link previews, blurbs and URLs, so we’ve asked for clarification here.  As Facebook and Instagram restyle themselves to boost usage, a question arises about design ethics. Is building a better mousetrap beneficial to society? Facebook and Instagram certainly allow communities and friend groups to grow their bonds, but when does fruitful exchange and sentimental entertainment give way to mindless scrolling? As former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris discusses in his TED talk, over-optimization for engagement on social networks has created apps that are addictive to the point of being destructive.  Over the years I’ve repeatedly asked Facebook’s top executives like CPO Chris Cox and VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri about whether the company is doing research into how to prevent or minimize internet addiction that can stem from Facebook’s ad-driven business model, and I’ve never gotten a direct answer that indicates they think it’s a priority. They do care about their users’ experience, with Cox telling me “We’re getting to a size where it’s worth really taking a careful look at what are all the things that we can do to make social media the most positive force for good possible.” But you can always have too much of a good thing. The execs tell me Facebook wants to make sure all your time spent on its apps is “meaningful”. Yet at some point when people are sitting in the dark alone refreshing the feed over and over, it could be worth surfacing Internet addiction and mental health tips, or encouraging them to connect directly with a friend via messaging. Perhaps one day our apps will be redesigned not just to soak up more attention, but to warn us when we’re neglecting everything else.  \n",

            "159 Facebook adds eBay’s Daily Deals to its Marketplace on mobile\n",
            "Facebook  is again getting into the daily deals space, this time in collaboration with eBay. The company has launched a new feature within its Marketplace section on its mobile app, where a selection of inventory from eBay’s  Daily Deals program is now available. The deals can be shopped directly in Facebook’s app, but checkout takes place on eBay’s website through an in-app browser. The new addition expands the focus for Marketplace, Facebook’s answer to Craigslist. This section today is prominently positioned in Facebook’s mobile app, occupying the central spot on the bottom bar on iOS (or top bar on Android), in between the Video and Notifications icons.  Launched publicly last fall, the idea has been to aggregate the “for sale” postings from the social network’s various “buy and sell” groups, allowing for an easier, more centralized way to search and shop for items from local sellers. You can also list your own items for sale, and chat with buyers or sellers via Marketplace’s integration with Messenger. To date, however, it has been a peer-to-peer marketplace, not a source for deals from third-party websites, like eBay. That has now changed, as some users will see a new “Daily Deals” section when clicking into Marketplace.    The deals will emphasize those products in the Consumer Electronics, Fashion, and Home & Garden categories. At the top of the page, there’s a countdown that indicates how long the deals will be available. Each item also displays the percentage off. But to see the actual sale price, you have to click into the deal itself. There will be around 100 new items posted to this section daily, we understand. Deals can be shared with others via SMS or Messenger, which will link to the deal via eBay’s ShopBot app. Facebook characterizes this as a test. “We’re conducting a test to determine if people are interested in shopping for discounted products when they visit Marketplace,” said Facebook Product Manager, Akash Anand, in a statement shared with TechCrunch. The Daily Deals feature is currently available to a small percentage of people in the U.S. as of earlier this month, and is displaying on both the Android and iOS Facebook mobile apps.  While eBay is the current source for these deals, Facebook’s arrangement with eBay is not exclusive. That means if this proves to be a popular feature, Facebook could expand Daily Deals to include those from other third parties as well. For the time being, transaction revenue is not being shared between eBay and Facebook. Instead, users who click on a deal will be linked over to the eBay website within the Facebook app, where they can view more product details, and complete their purchase. Daily deals is an area Facebook explored years ago, during Groupon’s heyday. The idea back then was to connect users to deals for area restaurants, shops, group activities, and more, from local businesses. But these days, businesses that want to reach customers on Facebook set up their own Pages, and run ads. Plus, the can entice users with Facebook Offers, which can also be run as ads. The new Daily Deals section, on the other hand, gives Facebook more of a “real” shopping feature – a way to browse products from eBay’s trusted sellers, then buy right in the Facebook app.  Though a different angle on daily deals than before, it’s not the first time Facebook has dabbled with enabling commerce on its site. Most notably, the current “Shops” feature (originally called the “Shopping” feed) pulls in product listings from Facebook Pages, then lets you checkout from the seller’s own website, while still in Facebook. Facebook has not publicly announced the Daily Deals feature, as it remains a test. It’s not clear when or if the feature may become more broadly available, but we understand it’s not connected with the European Marketplace expansion news announced yesterday. Ebay also confirmed the test of Daily Deals on Facebook. “At eBay, we are always looking to broaden our reach and surface inventory through new channels,” a spokesperson said. “We are currently running a test with a small subset of people on Facebook in the U.S. who can browse eBay’s Daily Deals on Facebook Marketplace.”  \n",

Today Facebook added the ability to go Live, shoot two-second GIFs and share full-screen text posts on colored background from Facebook Camera, which lets you share to Facebook Stories, Direct messaging and the traditional News Feed.  The features give Facebook Camera near parity with Instagram’s Stories camera, and could make it more flexible and attractive to teens looking for ways to share visually. Combining the Camera’s augmented reality face filters with Live could make people more comfortable broadcasting since they won’t have to show their real face. Facebook had already offered colored backgrounds for status updates through the traditional composer. It tested a GIF creator in Camera last month. And Facebook tested Live via Camera earlier this month, after allowing users to go Live from the News Feed composer since 2016. But now Facebook is officially rolling out these features to all iOS and Android users. Facebook globally launched Camera and 24-hour ephemeral Stories in March, declaring war on Snapchat directly after fighting by proxy via Instagram since last year. But while Snapchat clones Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status have both surpassed the original to hit 250 million daily users, Facebook hasn’t given updates on how many people use its Camera and Stories. Critics in the West, where Snapchat and Instagram are popular, have dubbed Facebook Camera “redundant.” Some ask why we need multiple Facebook-owned properties to share the same Stories. Others find the Story bubbles atop the feed obtrusive, especially when people seem to be pouring very little content into the distribution channel. Right now only four of my friends have a Story posted. But between Facebook’s launch of the augmented reality Camera Effects Platform in April and today’s addition of new features, Facebook seems hell-bent on making its Camera popular. It could always cut and run, folding Facebook Camera and directing users to Instagram Stories. But if Mark Zuckerberg is convinced video and visual communication is the future, and is betting Facebook can lead by offering an AR development platform Snapchat lacks, the company may be willing to take its lumps and wait for the trends to push people to Camera.  \n",

            "161 Facebook is rolling out a Trending News section on mobile, now with its own link\n",
            "Facebook  is rolling out a “Trending News” section on mobile that includes its own link in the app’s main navigation. This follows the company’s earlier announcement this spring of a redesign for Trending Topics, an increasingly important part of Facebook’s social network, where it tracks the news stories that are buzzing across its service. That redesign is now rolling out to users on iPhone and Android devices in the U.S., while the added navigational link to Trending News became available on iPhone over the past few weeks, and is in testing on Android, Facebook tells us.  In case you missed Facebook’s announcement in May, the Trending Topics section was redesigned with a focus on making it easier to see how other publications are covering a topic, in addition to what friends and public figures are saying about the matter. When you click into a Trending Topic following the update, Facebook explained you will see a carousel of stories from other publications that you swipe through horizontally.  The publications linked to in this section are determined by engagement around both the article and publisher in general on Facebook, as well as what other articles are linking to it. This card-style carousel look-and-feel was inspired in part by Facebook Paper, the company’s long since shuttered standalone news reading app. This carousel is still in the process of rolling out across the U.S. Trending News feature in Facebook iOS app. #Facebook pic.twitter.com/uFhsOibwz0 — Jose Gutierrez (@fbjag) August 9, 2017  However, one aspect to Trending’s makeover that wasn’t really touched on during Facebook’s earlier announcement was how Facebook was toying with a redesigned list of news stories that focused on headlines, not just “trending topics.” The original look for Facebook’s Trending Topics – which you pull up with a tap into the app’s search box – is a simple list of topics and the beginning of a lede that’s usually cut off. These appear below your own recent Facebook searches in the app. However, if you access the new Trending News link that’s just popped up in Facebook’s navigation menu, you’ll see an entirely different sort of Trending section.  Above: Old Trending on left vs New Trending on right Instead of a “topic” (often just a word, person or place, like “China” or “Donald Trump”) and squiggly arrow icon, the news stories here include a headline, a photo, the name of a major media outlet that’s reporting it, and how many other sources are available on the topic. For example, next to the headline, it might say: “Reuters and 100+ other sources.” Plus, by adding the photo next to each item, there’s more room for expanded information – that is, a full headline and sourcing. The new section also gives stories a rank (#1, #2, #3,…etc.) Facebook’s prior announcement in May didn’t specifically detail how this Trending News section looked different from Trending Topics. Frankly, it’s all a bit confusing, because Trending Topics and Trending News don’t seem to be tied directly together at this point. For example, you could have the link to Trending News in your app’s main navigation, but still not have the new look for Trending Topics, which includes the carousel redesign. However, in that same post, we did get a little peek at Trending News – but it was referenced as being a part of a “small test.”  Trending integration in News Feed still a “small test” Facebook said then it was testing adding the top three Trending News stories to users’ News Feeds. In a screenshot of this, you were able see this list of stories with photos that were ranked by numbers, as well as stories identified by headlines instead of just “topics.” This integration of a “mini” Trending News section into News Feed is not broadly available. That remains a “small test,” we understand. But the addition of the Trending News link to Facebook’s navigation is already live on iPhone, and being trialed on Android. Of course, any changes Facebook makes to Trending are sure to met with a lot of scrutiny. The company last year faced criticism when it removed its human editors who curated this section, to run Trending by way of algorithms instead. (And those algorithms soon screwed up.) The social network has more recently made several changes to address the spread of fake news and filter bubbles, as well. In this case, though, Facebook is not monkeying with how news is selected as “Trending,” only how it’s being displayed. The new Trending News section joins a number of other new additions to Facebook’s main navigation as of late, including the food ordering option, Town Hall, weather, the Explore feed, and more. Not all these additions have stuck around – the new travel-focused City Guides section, for instance, has since disappeared.  \n",

            "Facebook  has acquired a German company called Fayteq that builds software add-ons for video editing that can remove and add whole objects from captured video using computer vision. The acquisition was first reported by a German startup publication (via Variety) and confirmed to TechCrunch, and could be useful as Facebook pursues additional video filter creation technology, both for its live streaming efforts, and for platforms like Instagram Stories. Of course, being able to add objects to live video and remove them or cover them over on the fly is also something that can be put to interesting use in the emerging field of augmented reality. Facebook launched an AR platform for its built-in camera feature in April at this year’s F8, with the aim of encouraging developers to build AR experiences for use in Facebook on smartphones, which Mark Zuckerberg  has said will be “the first augmented reality platform that becomes mainstream.” Some aspects of this platform include recognizing real-world objects captured by a smartphone camera and applying digital effects specific to those objects. Facebook’s move into becoming an AR platform was made more interesting when Apple revealed plans to actually do much the same thing at a system level throughout iOS with ARKit, which makes it astonishingly simple for developers to add virtual objects to scenes. Fayteq’s expertise could help Facebook continue to build out this area of its product plans, and its IP and patents could help the social network own the results of its work in AR more definitively, too. Facebook confirmed the acquisition, but had no additional info to share regarding their plans for the company.  \n",

            "163 Facebook password stealing software comes packed with a trojan that steals your passwords\n",
            "Facebook  malware is nothing new, but an emerging threat offers some unique karmic retribution. In an unpublished report, security researchers at Sydney-based LMNTRIX Labs have identified software advertising itself as a Facebook password stealer that injects malicious code in the background once downloaded, making the user vulnerable to having their own credentials stolen. “This appears very widespread and growing,” the research team told TechCrunch. “We classified this as an ongoing malicious campaign with the threat actors actively marketing it as ‘Facebook Password Stealer’ or, more innocuously, ‘Facebook Password Recovery.’ “The attackers also seem to be sophisticated marketers who understand there is potentially big demand for the purported service and are distributing the sample via Spam, Ad campaigns, Pop-ups, Bundled Software, Porn sites and also some times as a standalone software.”  Fittingly dubbed “Instant Karma” by the LMNTRIX  researchers, the malware campaign lures victims who are seeking software that can crack into other people’s Facebook accounts. Once downloaded and run, it drops a remote access trojan in the background after the victim clicks the “hack” button.  The researchers cross-referenced the contents of “spoolsvfax.exe” with VirusTotal’s database, where they identified it as containing a newly uploaded trojan.  Before identified and neutralized, Facebook malware that offers useful (if sketchy) services often thrives thanks to Facebook’s incomparably massive user base. It can take many forms, from tempting downloads that offer to notify a user when they are unfriended to malware bots posing as a friend on Messenger. A simple search of “hack Facebook account” yields pages of results and links to all manner of likely malware-tainted software solutions, many of which are targeted toward the average user, no technical skill required. This particular threat appears limited to Windows desktop users, though malware targeting Facebook’s mobile experience isn’t uncommon either. It’s no surprise that the largest social network in the world is a hacker goldmine if tricks like these can be leveraged successfully. “The target market goes beyond a typical hacker subset (if there is such a thing) and targets the general user who may be tempted to get inside someone’s Facebook account (friends, enemies, significant others, et al.),” the researchers told TechCrunch. “While there have been methods and apps offering Facebook hacks, this specific malicious campaign which uses the promise of easy Facebook password theft as bait is completely new.”  \n",

            "164 Facebook launches Watch tab of original video shows\n",
            "Facebook  has a new home for original video content produced exclusively for it by partners, who will earn 55 percent of ad break revenue while Facebook keeps 45 percent. The “Watch” tab and several dozen original shows will start rolling out  to a small group of U.S. users tomorrow on mobile, desktop and Facebook’s TV apps. By hosting original programming, Facebook could boost ad revenue and give people a reason to frequently return to the News Feed for content they can’t get anywhere else. Watch features personalized recommendations of live and recorded shows to watch, plus categories like “Most Talked About,” “What’s Making People Laugh” and “Shows Your Friends Are Watching.” Publishers can also share their shows to the News Feed to help people discover them. A Watchlist feature lets you subscribe to updates on new episodes of your favorite shows. Fans can connect with each other and creators through a new feature that links shows to Groups.  Facebook says it plans to roll out access to Watch to more users and more content creators soon, starting with the rest of the U.S. before expanding internationally. Users with access will see a TV-shaped Watch button in the bottom navigation bar of Facebook’s main app that opens the new video hub. Facebook admits that “we’ve also funded some shows” as examples, but notes that these are only a small percentage of all the available shows. “We want any publisher/creator who is interested to be able to create a show in the future,” a Facebook spokesperson tells me. “So there will be hundreds of shows at launch, and we’ll hopefully scale to thousands.” Business Insider reported some leaked details about the redesign earlier today, but pegged the launch of original programming as starting August 28th, when the shows actually will begin to roll out tomorrow. Facebook’s shows will run the gamut from live event coverage to reality TV to scripted programs.  “More and more people are coming to Facebook in order to watch video” Facebook’s director of video product Daniel Danker tells me. “When they come with that in mind, we want to make a place for them where they can find that video, connect with the creators and publishers they love, and know they won’t miss out if there’s a new episode from one of those creators.” Here’s a list of some of the original programming that will be available on Watch: What’s clearly absent is the type of longer-form scripted dramas and comedies people are used to watching on television. Instead, there are plenty of mini-documentaries, reality shows, and sports coverage. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg writes that “We believe it’s possible to rethink a lot of experiences through the lens of building community — including watching video. Watching a show doesn’t have to be passive . . . You’ll be able to chat and connect with people during an episode, and join groups with people who like the same shows afterwards to build community.” When you open Watch, you’ll be able to scroll through a long list of categories of shows to view. Alternatively, you can either swipe over or arrive from a notification about a new episode to view the Watchlist of all the lastest shows released by creators you follow. Once you’ve opened an episode you’ll see all the details about it, with one tab for joining a live comment reel with other viewers, and an “Up Next” tab displaying what you’ll view after the current episode if you prefer a glazed-eyes lean-back experience. There’s no specific content restrictions on swearing or violence beyond Facebook’s existing community standards, but Facebook will monitor for shows that get flagged. Publishers can choose to insert ad breaks if they want to earn money off their shows, though the guidelines on where and how long they can be are still being finalized. If publishers want to give away their content, they don’t have to show ads. Another option is to do product placed or branded content, in which case the creator has to tag the sponsor paying them for transparency. Shows will have their own dedicated Facebook Pages, and creators can set up special show Groups where fans can ask questions and geek out together. Beyond the Watch tab, you can also discover shows through the News Feed if a publisher you follow posts an episode or friends are talking about it. That gives Facebook the opportunity to artificially boost the presence of shows in News Feed to build a bigger audience for the new content initiative. Facebook first launched its dedicated video tab in April 2016, but it only hosted the more generic News Feed videos people were already seeing from Pages and friends. Now Facebook is in the business of funding original content, initially through direct payments, though it seeks to switch entirely to a revenue-share model in the future to make its original programming effort sustainable. Facebook’s competitors like YouTube and Snapchat have already experimented with creating original video content. YouTube Red funds several original series, giving bigger production budgets to some of its biggest stars. Snapchat has tried making its own shows in-house, but now focuses on signing deals with partners like TV studios to get fresh, vertical video content into its Discover section. Facebook’s benefit is that Watch is cross-platform, allowing people to view videos from all their devices, while also being a daily destination for 1.32 billion users. It’s already become a powerhouse in serendipitous video discovery via the News Feed, and Watch will surely provide enough suggestions to get people hooked on shows they weren’t expecting. But through premium original programming, Facebook is also trying to become a home for deliberate video consumption where people come to view a specific show. While there are already plenty of reasons to visit Facebook, original shows give people a reason to spend longer staring at their screens. If it can drive enough viewers to these shows thanks to its 2 billion total users, Facebook could offer significant revenue-share payouts, attracting better and better content creators. Facebook’s been trying to eat the whole internet for years now. With Watch and these shows, it’s breaking out of the web to challenge traditional television, which is seeing viewership slide. As ad spends follow eyeballs from TV to the web, Watch could give Facebook a way to net more attention and dollars.  \n",

            "165 Facebook bans ‘cloaking’ of spam sites that fool filters\n",
            "“Cloaking” sounds sci-fi, but it’s actually a trick used today by spammers to show content moderators or search engine spiders an innocent-looking version of their site while real visitors just see ads and scams. For example, some spammers try to fool Facebook’s  review team and tech by showing any of its staffers’ IP addresses a benign landing page for links or ads, while everyone else sees diet pill scams or porn that violate Facebook’s community standards and ad policies. So today, Facebook is cracking down on cloaking. Facebook ads product director Rob Leathern tells me now when it discovers a site using cloaking, “We’ll deactivate their ad counts, we’ll kick them off, we’ll get rid of their Pages.” Facebook will use both humans and expanded artificial intelligence systems to root out cloakers. However, it’s not publicly disclosing the signals it uses to identify cloaking so it doesn’t tip-off the spammers. Innocent businesses should see no impact. “There’s no legitimate use case for cloaking,” Leathern says. “If we find it, it doesn’t really matter who that actor is. They’re usually bad actors and spammers by definition. So the line is if anyone does this in any way, shape, or form, we want them off the platform.” Here, Facebook is merely seeking out cloaking, rather than passing judgement on site content. The change comes as part of a multi-pronged attack on hoaxes, clickbait, spam and low-quality sites following criticism that Facebook didn’t prevent fake news from influencing the 2016 presidential election. By cutting off traffic to spam sites, Facebook can choke out the financial lifeblood of bad actors spreading misinformation for profit or political motives. According to a recent study of 4 million posts by more than 450 Facebook Pages spreading hyperpartisan political news, BuzzFeed concluded that “Publishers are obsessed with Facebook’s algorithm changes and with avoiding getting caught up in the social network’s stepped-up initiative to reduce clickbait and misinformation in the News Feed.” Cloaking isn’t just a Facebook problem, though. That’s why it plans to work with other tech companies to share strategies for defeating cloakers. Facebook tells me it’s early days in these conversations with the industry about how to address this more collectively. But if it shares the fingerprints of cloakers the way it does to thwart uploads of terrorist content or child pornography, Facebook could use experience from its massive scale to inoculate fellow fixtures of the internet.  \n",

            "166 Rothy’s, whose ballet flats are all over Facebook and Pinterest, has raised $7 million in funding\n",
            "You’ve likely seen them plastered across your social media accounts, if not on someone’s feet in San Francisco, where the company is based: attractive women’s flats in bright red with black soles, or bright red with pink stripes and blue detailing, or a gray camo pattern with a red sole. Rothy’s, available online only at the company’s site, suddenly seem to be everywhere. What’s the appeal? In addition to their aesthetics, the shoes are highly eco-friendly. Founders Roth Martin and Stephen Hawthornthwaite — a former gallery owner and investment banker, respectively — say the company has now used more than five million plastic water bottles to create an undisclosed number of shoes. How? After sourcing the bottles from recycling centers, they are “hot-washed” and sterilized, chipped into tiny flakes, then shaped into pellets that are then melted into malleable, thread-like fibers that get weaved into shoes by car-size knitting machines. Right now, the shoes are available in two silhouettes — a rounded and a pointed-toe version. Shoppers further have 20 patterns from which to choose. Yesterday, TechCrunch talked with Martin and Hawthornthwaite about how, given their very different backgrounds, they came together to form this modern shoe company. We also talked about the company’s funding picture, including the $5 million that it quietly raised from Lightspeed Venture Partners  in April. (The company had earlier raised $2 million in convertible notes, including from Finn Capital Partners, M13 and Grace Beauty Capital.) Our chat has been edited for length. TC: Neither of you worked in retail. How did Rothy’s come into being? SH: I’d spent around 18 years focused on M&A [at various banks]. A lot of what I’d worked on was in e-commerce and highly relevant, and by 2010, I was ready to make a change and really wanted to build something on my own. Roth and I have been friends for about 10 years, and professionally, he was in the same place. He’d been running a gallery and wanted to bring his design aesthetic [to something new]. RM: We were at a dinner and started kicking ideas around. We both have a passion for consumer goods and discussed a number of ideas but settled on footwear based on a number of trends we saw developing, including women wearing workout clothes whether or not they were working out. We wanted to create a front-of-the-closet shoe that she [the customer] can gravitate toward, without knowing what’s happening on a particular day. TC: How did you decide to create knitted footwear, specifically? RM: What drew us to knitting was the ability to create shaped art. Instead of cutting a circle from a square, one could knit a circle and eliminate waste in doing so. In typical manufacturing, 30 percent of materials can end up as waste. So we innovated by being able to program shaped parts. That drew us to knitting, then that drew us to footwear. [I will add that] the requirements of footwear in terms of fit and standardization is really complicated; we had no appreciation for that at the time. TC: Where are the shoes made? SH: We have 100 employees in southern China, working in a 65,000-square-foot factory that we own. The shoes are made by knitting machines that are about the size of a car, and which we’ve been adding to quickly to keep up with demand. We have waitlists for certain items; demand is still outstripping our expectations, but we’re catching up. TC: What’s your marketing strategy? I can’t open Facebook without seeing a Rothy’s ad. SH: Word of mouth is a huge element; customers email us all the time, delighted with their discovery of the shoes. The Facebook strategy is to visually make people who haven’t heard of Rothy’s aware of the product. Despite that you may be seeing a number of ads, we’re not spending as much money on Facebook when you look at it holistically. We’re seeing great return on our ad spend, but it’s way less than half our marketing budget. TC: What other platforms are giving you the most bang for your buck? RM: Facebook is important. We’re also using Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Bing, keyword advertising. I’d say we’re getting good traction on Instagram; any platform that’s particularly visual is effective. TC: Many e-commerce companies are jumping right into off-line channels to raise brand awareness. You had a pop-up store at a farmer’s market in San Francisco. Is a brick-and-mortar store in your future? SH: No. For now, we’re focused on direct-to-consumer. We have no wholesale or retail strategy. TC: What about other products? What’s coming? RM: We’re taking a really disciplined approach to any new categories. What we’re selling isn’t going to change any time soon. Where we’d like to innovate right now is by continuing to invest in our fiber technology. TC: How long is the production cycle? RM: We’re writing purchase orders for 15 days from now, so it’s a very nimble and responsive manufacturing process. We’re not taking a lot of inventory risk; this is just-in-time manufacturing. TC: You’ve used five million water bottles so far. How many bottles go into each shoe? SH: We don’t release that information. TC: In other words, you aren’t talking about how many shoes you’ve sold so far. I’ve also read that you donate an undisclosed percent of each purchase to an organization, the Ocean Cleanup Project. Why that organization, and can you be more specific about what you’re donating? RM: We haven’t put a stake in the ground as it relates to the ocean per se. They have one of the most innovative approaches going, but we’re always looking for equally beneficial technologies. [Regarding how much we donate], there’s no [hard-and-fixed percentage]. We intend to give generously when we can. TC: Which shoes are selling best, and are you profitable? SH: We’ve been profitable since the beginning. Our sales break pretty evenly between the point and [rounded toe]. Our most popular color is black. Generally, black shoes outsell others in the industry by a significant margin. TC: I’ve read that the shoes themselves can be recycled. Does that say something about their durability? Also, is this something you’re actively encouraging customers to think about? RM: The shoes last a really long time. Our wives are still wearing pairs that are several years old at this point. With washing — and their washability is a key selling point — they come out looking brand new. To recycle, customers can just go to our website, print up a label at the end of [their shoes’] life, and they can be used [by Plusfoam, a partner company that makes other performance materials] for low-grade carpets and other things.

            "167 Facebook says it’s removing accidental clicks from its ad network\n",
            "Advertisers on Facebook’s  Audience Network will no longer have to worry that they’re paying for users who accidentally clicked on their ads. I’m betting we’ve all had moments where we were scrolling or swiping or clicking through a website/mobile app and we ended up clicking on an ad without really meaning to. (Those moments probably outnumber the times I’ve intentionally clicked on an ad.) So Product Marketing Manager Brett Vogel said Facebook won’t be charging for those clicks in its Audience Network (where Facebook runs ads in other apps), and those clicks won’t be included in the metrics shared with advertisers and publishers. Facebook is sorting out unintentional clicks by discounting instances where a user bounces back after two seconds or less. After all, if you clicked on an ad and then immediately clicked back, you probably didn’t care about the ad. Still, Vogel said the two-second threshold is a “starting point” that Facebook can adjust if necessary. Publishers may worry that this change could hurt their bottom line, but Vogel said the “vast majority” will not be affected, because their ads aren’t driving a significant number of unintentional clicks. He added that Facebook is making the change for the good of the ecosystem. “Unintentional clicks end up delivering really poor experiences for people and advertisers,” he said. “It’s not a good path for publishers to build sustainable businesses.” In addition, Facebook is also announcing that it’s making new ad metrics available (it’s been making a broader push around this). Those metrics including gross impressions, a number that combines billable impressions with non-billable impressions — advertisers aren’t paying for things like non-human traffic, but some of them have still asked to see the numbers. Facebook is also adding auto-refresh impressions (those are ad impressions for banners on the right-hand side) and gross auto-refresh impressions.  \n",

            "168 Facebook shuts down its Snapchat competitor Lifestage and its standalone Groups app\n",
            "Facebook  is paring down its collection of standalone apps. The company’s experimental “teens-only” app Lifestage, designed to counteract Snapchat’s threat, has been pulled from the App Store. Its disappearance was first spotted by Business Insider, and Facebook confirmed its removal. However, Lifestage isn’t the only Facebook app that’s being killed off as of late – the company is also closing down its Groups app, first launched in 2014 to help users better discover, search and connect with their various Facebook Groups. In its announcement about the Groups’ app’s closure, Facebook said it believed the team could do more for the community by working on improvements to Groups within the main Facebook app. It seems that’s been the case for some time, however. The Facebook Groups app had grown to be very buggy in recent months, often to the point of becoming unusable. And it didn’t look like Facebook had any interest in fixing those glitches, much less continuing to roll out improvements to the Groups app overall.  Groups, I’d argue, ultimately failed because it didn’t address the problem with using Groups on Facebook at all. There was no News Feed in the app where you could browse just Group posts without Page updates and status updates from friends mixed in; there was no universal search across your Groups; and there was no way to organize Groups into collections for easier access, among other oversights. The app itself has already been removed from the App Store, and will stop functioning for existing users on September 1st, Facebook says. While Facebook Groups is still a key focus for the social network going forward – if not as its own, separate mobile experience – it’s not as surprising that Facebook shutting down Lifestage. That app, by design, targeted a limited user base – only those 21 or younger could even sign up. Launched last year by then 19-year old product designer Michael Sayman, Lifestage put a heavy emphasis on video and on getting to know your friends through a Q&A type experience. But Facebook no longer needs a direct counterpoint to Snapchat. It has Instagram. In April, Instagram’s Stories feature hit 200 million users, surpassing Snapchat’s user base of 161 million. As of this month, Instagram Stories has 250 million daily users compared to Snapchat’s 166 million. The company has blatantly ripped off some of Snapchat’s best features, like its augmented reality and selfie filters. Its ability to clone Snapchat’s features is speeding up, TechCrunch’s Josh Constine also recently noted. Though it took nearly three years to launch its version of Stories, Instagram was able to copy the “create your stickers” feature in four months. That leaves little need to continue to focus on an app like Lifestage, which never became an App Store success. At the beginning of August, it was ranked #1,392 on the iOS’s free charts in the U.S., and unranked on Google Play. This is not the first time Facebook has cleaned house of under-performing apps. A couple of years ago, it closed down its internal incubator Creative Labs, along with several of its apps, including photo-sharing app Slingshot, anonymous chat app Rooms, and collaborative video app Riff.  \n",

            "169 Facebook tests ‘going live’ from Facebook Camera, Live Stories like Instagram\n",
            "Facebook  is testing a new way to “go live” on its social network – an option that was previously available by pressing the “Live” button on the Status update box. Now, for some users, the ability to “go live” – meaning start a live video broadcast – is appearing right within the Facebook Camera screen, alongside other options, like the ability to use Facebook Live Audio, or create a GIF. Live streaming on Facebook was a feature first introduced back in 2015, initially only for public figures and celebrities. It later rolled out to regular Facebook users via the company’s iOS and Android applications, and, at the beginning of this year, to the desktop. With the growing popularity of podcasts, Facebook later also added a Live Audio feature, designed largely for publishers and authors, who use it for things like news radio-like shows, book readings, and other audio-only broadcasts. New look for Facebook Live via camera button and Facebook Live Audio available now. #Facebook pic.twitter.com/KsQVeQFvyU — Jose Gutierrez (@fbjag) August 4, 2017  But you can’t “go live” from the Facebook Camera today, which actually seems a little odd. It makes sense to combine all camera-related functions on just one screen, as this test is doing. That includes taking a personal photo or video to share on Facebook, using photo filters, making a GIF (another option still in testing), or recording live audio and live video. For those who are seeing the new version of Facebook Camera, the different functions are appearing across the top of the screen under tabs that read “Live,” “Normal,” and “GIF.” When you’re on the “Live” tab, you can tap on an icon of a video camera to live stream video, or tap on a microphone icon to just stream audio.  What’s more, the new feature also offers you the option to go live just in your Facebook Story, as opposed to sharing your live video in a regular Facebook post. Or you can “go live” both in your Facebook Story and post at the same time.

            "Fantasy sports, and probably to an even greater extent daily fantasy sports, can be intimidating. You’re usually playing for real money, and potentially going up against people who spend countless hours researching statistics to craft the perfect lineup. Gameday, a startup part of Y Combinator’s Summer ’17 batch, wants to change this by making a few tweaks to daily fantasy sports so it can be accessible to everyone. First, they’re building it into Messenger. This means you don’t have to visit a dedicated site each day and navigate a complicated UI – you just open Messenger and start chatting with their bot, which walks you through entering games and creating lineups. It’s also totally free to play, which also cuts down on the intimidation factor and makes it fan (and family) friendly. Users can select real prizes like apparel and gift cards that can be bought with in-app currency awarded to contest winners. And the last difference is that the games offered are simpler and designed to be more fun to play than traditional daily fantasy sports. For example, Gameday’s  NFL contest has you pick just four players, one WR, TE, RB and QB from a pool of 10 players the startup selected that week. Picking four players from a pool of ten is infinitely less stressful than picking a lineup of 9 or 10 from a pool of hundreds. Because if you’re just a casual sports fan, sometimes these complicated lineups and salary caps can be a little too daunting. And the big sites actually agree too, as FanDuel recently introduced a “lite” versions of a daily fantasy sports product designed for casual users. You can play in random leagues or ones you create with your friends, and soon you’ll be able to play inside group Messenger chats, as soon as Facebook adds support for apps inside group chats. Gameday also offers NBA, MLB, NHL and Premier League games – all with slightly different gameplay structures. Before the NHL season ended the startup had 25,000 people playing each day, with their 75% of those users never playing daily fantasy sports before…proving the concept that if you make a simpler game for casual fans they will come. If you have Messenger installed, you can click here to start chatting with Gameday’s bot and playing.     \n",

            "171 Facebook finishes its move to neural machine translation\n",
            "Facebook announced this morning that it had completed its move to neural machine translation — a complicated way of saying that Facebook  is now using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to automatically translate content across Facebook. Google,  Microsoft and Facebook have been making the move to neural machine translation for some time now, rapidly leaving old-school phrase-based statistical machine translation behind. There are a lot of reasons why neural approaches show more promise than phrase-based approaches, but the bottom line is that they produce more accurate translations. Traditional machine translation is a fairly explicit process. Relying on key phrases, phrase-based systems translate sentences then probabilistically determine a final translation. You can think of this in a similar light as using the Rosetta Stone (identical phrases in multiple languages) to translate text. In contrast, neural models deal in a higher level of abstraction. The interpretation of a sentence becomes part of a multi-dimensional vector representation, which really just means we’re trying to translate based on some semblance of “context” rather than phrases. Facebook Status update translation It’s not a perfect process, and researchers are still tinkering with how to deal with long-term dependencies (i.e. retaining understanding and accuracy throughout a long text), but the approach is incredibly promising and has produced great results, thus far, for those implementing it. Google announced the first stage of its move to neural machine translation in September 2016 and Microsoft made a similar announcement two months later. Facebook has been working on its conversion efforts for about a year and it’s now at full deployment. Facebook AI Research (FAIR) published its own research on the topic back in May and open sourced its CNN models on GitHub. “Our problem is different than that of most of the standard places, mostly because of the type of language we see at Facebook,” Necip Fazil Ayan, engineering manager in Facebook’s language technologies group, explained to me in an interview. “We see a lot of informal language and slang acronyms. The style of language is very different.” Facebook has seen about a 10 percent jump in translation quality. You can read more into the improvement in FAIR’s research. The results are particularly striking for languages that lack a lot of data in the form of comparative translation pairs.  \n",

            "172 Facebook begins testing Stories on the desktop\n",
            "Great news, folks. Facebook  Stories, the shameless Snapchat clone that sits above the News Feed on Facebook’s mobile app, is now rolling out to Facebook’s desktop site. Here, the Stories feature is no longer at the top of the page, but is instead off to the right side, where it’s at least a bit less intrusive. A small question mark icon appears in the Stories module, as well, which will explain the feature’s purpose, when hovered over with your cursor. The explanation simply states that Stories consist of photos and video that are visible for 24 hours before they disappear. Facebook has confirmed to TechCrunch the Stories launch on desktop is still considered a test, but notes that a wider rollout is expected soon. The company chose to bring Stories to Facebook, after seeing its success on Instagram, where Stories had debuted in summer 2016.  With the first five months, Instagram Stories soared to 150 million daily users. It now has 250 million daily users, compared with Snapchat’s 166 million. Half of the businesses on Instagram created a story in the past month, Facebook also announced this week, and Instagram’s average usage has climbed to 32 minutes per day for those under 25, and 24 minutes per day for those 25 and up, it said. The feature arrived on Facebook at the beginning of 2017, initially in Ireland before expanding to other countries, including the U.S. The company has credited Snapchat with pioneering the visual communication format, but believes the pivot into Stories goes beyond simply copying a competitor’s popular app. Like Facebook’s News Feed – a format that went on to become the standard across social apps – Stories are a new way to share. That’s led to the format being broadly adopted across the industry. Facebook itself has added Stories to Instagram, Messenger, and its flagship app. It even tried a Stories-like feature in WhatsApp. Elsewhere, Stories is inspiring redesigns of other top apps, including most recently, Tinder, Match, and Skype. However, on Facebook, the feature hasn’t seen as much traction. In fact, there were so few people using Stories on Facebook’s mobile app, that the company in April began to display grayed-out icons of your most frequently contacted friends instead of blank spaces in the Stories feature that no one much was using. It’s unclear that bringing Facebook Stories to the desktop web will impact its usage significantly. Perhaps, after all, there are only so many places users want to post this sort of ephemeral content, and for the time being, people have chosen Instagram. It makes one wonder at which point Facebook will acknowledge this, and choose to swap in or sync Instagram stories to Facebook’s Stories feature instead. Facebook hasn’t yet confirmed what percentage of users are seeing Stories on the desktop, but it’s not broadly available. However, we are aware of users seeing the module outside the U.S.  \n",

            "173 Facebook fights fake news with links to other angles\n",
            "Facebook  will become the suggester of perspective to avoid being the “arbiter of truth”. It’s rolling out “Related Articles” that appear below news links to stories lots of people are posting about on Facebook, or that are suspected to be false news and have been externally fact checked by Facebook’s partners. Appearing before someone reads, Related Articles will surface links to additional reporting on the same topic to provide different view points, and to truthiness reports from the fact checkers. If users see drastically different angles when they compare a story to its Related Articles, they might deem it suspicious and skip it, be less likely to believe or share it, or could click through the Related Articles and make up their own mind. That could reduce the spread and impact of false news without Facebook itself having to be the honesty police. Related Articles could also balance out some of the radical invective that can subtly polarize the populace. Pre-click Related Articles are rolling out in the US, Germany, France, and Nederlands today. These countries were chosen to get the roll out first because Facebook has established fact checking partnerships there. “We don’t want to be and are not the arbiters of the truth. The fact checkers can give the signal of whether a story is true or false” says Facebook News Feed integrity product manager Tessa Lyons. Meanwhile, Facebook’s machine learning algorithm has improved its accuracy and speed, so the social network  will now have it send more potential hoaxes to fact checkers. Lyons explains that the speed is important because “The sooner we can get potential false new stories to fact checkers, the sooner that they can review them, and the more we reduce the number of people who are actually exposed to them.” Facebook has shown Related Articles after people click links since at least 2014. Even then it was getting flack for dispensing fake news. In April of this year Facebook tested the new pre-click version as part of its multi-prong attack on fake news following criticism that misinformation influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election. That includes downranking hoaxes and click bait, reducing referral traffic to ad-filled spam sites to cut off their funding, and promoting local journalism and news literacy. Most directly, it partnered with Snopes, AP, PolitiFact and others external agencies so it can add warning labels to stories externally vetted as false. “People told us that Related Articles gave them more context about topics and that having more context helps them make more informed decisions and about what they read and what they decide to share” Lyons tells me. “Seeing Fact Checker’s articles in Related Articles actually helps people identify whether what they’re reading is misleading or false.”  Facebook won’t be personalizing the Related Articles that show a column of thumbnail images and headlines below a link story. However, it does utilize other quality signals from News Feed ranking to show the optimal alternative takes. Thankfully, Lyons says Facebook doesn’t plan to put any ads in the Related Articles box. So how does Facebook avoid accidentally showing more fake news in Related Articles? Facebook tells me it uses the same signals as its Trending section, and disqualifies posts that lots of people are commenting on or reporting as false. No humans are involved in the process, which at least removes the potential for direct bias, though humans tend to code their subconscious biases into their algorithms. If Facebook can’t convince the world it’s got a real handle on the fake news problem, it may see people tune into the News Feed or click its links less. That interferes with Facebook’s ad-driven business model and its mission. Plus, it’s liable to get blamed for future election results. While objectively fake news gets the majority of the attention, it’s exaggeration and warped opinion that are much more prevalent and therefore potentially polarizing. If extreme right and left publishers’ articles get paired with centrist Related Articles, it could dissuade people from blindly swallowing the rants and raves that tear society apart.  \n",

            "174 Another black activist, Ijeoma Oluo, is suspended by Facebook for posting about racism\n",
            "Activist and writer Ijeoma Oluo is the latest to suffer for Facebook’s inability — or perhaps unwillingness — to improve its reporting and moderation infrastructure. After receiving hundreds of racist and threatening messages in response to a joke she made on Twitter, Oluo began posting screenshots when it was clear that days of reporting did nothing. Facebook’s response was to suspend her account. You can read Oluo’s account of things here, including some screenshots of the type of abuse she was receiving. Twitter, she said, was responsive. Facebook, not so much. Facebook later reinstated her account, calling the suspension a “mistake.” I’ve asked the company for the rationale behind the suspension. We talked with another activist recently, Leslie Mac, who like Oluo spoke out on racism using the platform, and like Oluo was suspended from it. It happened to Shaun King, too, after he posted a racist email he received. The pattern isn’t hard to figure out: when a person (often a person of color, often a woman, often both) is singled out by popular accounts and pages for something they’ve said or done, the mob descends. Abusive messages, comments and tweets arrive by the truckload — and while the target can only block and report so fast, groups of hundreds or thousands can flag a post or account so voluminously that it is taken offline. Sure, that’s a “mistake.” The way the entire system Facebook has established for moderating the global conversation is a mistake. It is, at the very least, fundamentally flawed and inadequate. Facebook and other platforms love to talk about the empowering nature of a one-to-many platform. They fail to address the problem that occurs when the platform is inverted and becomes many-to-one. There isn’t really a solution for the constant dogpiles that occur when someone incurs the wrath of an entire contingent of highly vocal abusers. Just let it happen and then sweep the “mistake” under the rug with the rest of them. I happened to hear about Oluo’s situation by chance, but no doubt this is happening to many groups and many people whom I would never hear about. Are you one of them? Have you experienced this? Maybe the mistake is people thinking these platforms are able to protect them at all. If so, the echo chamber will intensify as Facebook and other services may find themselves hosts to chilled speech under the de facto sway of countless angry mobs. Facebook confirmed the content takedowns and suspension as mistakes on the part of its moderation team. They later sent a statement saying “We’re very sorry about this mistake. We allow discussions of racism but do not allow people to harass or attack others on Facebook.” It seems they got it backwards in this case! I’ve also asked Oluo for more information and will update the post if I hear back.  \n",

            "175 Facebook’s black employee representation has increased for the first time since 2014\n",
            "Facebook  is continuing to pick away at its diversity problem, which it shares with most companies in Silicon Valley. For the first time since 2014, Facebook has increased the overall representation of black employees from 2 percent to 3 percent in the U.S., according to the diversity report Facebook released today. In 2015, Facebook’s representation of black employees actually dropped to one percent but then bounced back up to 2 percent in 2016. This year is also the first time Facebook’s representation of white people has dropped below 50 percent. Today, Facebook is 49 percent white. In the last year, Facebook also increased the representation of Hispanic/Latinx employees from 4 percent to 5 percent.  Click to enlarge Worldwide, Facebook is 35 percent female compared to 33 percent this time last year. Over the past year, women made up 21 percent of all Facebook’s new technical hires. That helped bump up Facebook’s technical department from 17 percent female last year to 19 percent female this year. Facebook also has slightly more women in leadership roles (28 percent) than last year (27 percent). Last year, of the 61 percent of employees who responded to Facebook’s LGBTQA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or asexual), 7 percent identified in that way. This year, 67 percent of employees responded, but representation based on self-identification remained at 7 percent. This diversity report comes a few months after Facebook rejected claims of gender bias in its engineering department. Based on an analysis by an engineer at Facebook, it seemed that code written by female engineers at Facebook gets rejected more often than code written by men at the company. At the time of that report, Facebook told TechCrunch the analysis was “incomplete and inaccurate.” Then, in June, Facebook shareholders rejected a proposal for a gender pay equity report. Facebook, along with several other tech companies, has been releasing diversity reports for several years. Since releasing its first report in 2014, Facebook has made some improvements, but Maxine Williams, Facebook’s global head of diversity and inclusion, recognizes there’s more to do. “I want to get to excellence,” Williams told me over the phone yesterday. “Excellence means as many as possible. I want to outpace market availability (of underrepresented minorities).”  Click to enlarge In the last couple of years, Facebook has implemented unconscious bias trainings and, more recently, trainings around managing inclusion and being an ally. These trainings are designed to grow and keep people. With Managing Inclusion, the idea is to teach managers about the issues marginalized and underrepresented people may face. It’s essentially a training session on managing diverse teams. Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer pushed for and championed the ally training, Williams said. The idea was to do something deliberate to confirm the view that diversity benefits everyone at Facebook, and everything the company does. “Diversity is not just something that belongs to minorities and marginalized people,” Williams said. “Therefore we need to give everyone, including the straight, white, rich, cisgender men, the strength and mindset to help support everyone else, and support the opening up of spaces.” At this point, 100 percent of all senior leaders and 75 percent of all employees have taken Facebook’s Managing Bias course. The Managing Inclusion and Be an Ally courses are still new, so Facebook’s not quite willing to share that data. Facebook doesn’t make any of these trainings mandatory, because if you mandate something, Williams said, you’re not going to see real change implemented. “We make the bet on the long term by making it non-mandatory but doing things in the now to encourage people to take it,” Williams said. “With our approach, it’s kind of like spreading a philosophy throughout the company — speaking to people in ways they understand.” Moving forward, Williams said Facebook will continue to focus on finding, growing and keeping talent. The company will also continue to release diversity reports. “It’s a reminder to those of us working on [diversity] what we were able to do over the last 365 days,” Williams said. “But also a reminder of how far away we are from where we want to go.”  \n",

            "176 Facebook said to be working on dedicated video chat device\n",
            "Facebook  is reportedly working on dedicated video chat hardware, per a new report by Bloomberg. The device is said to be the inaugural major product from Facebook’s hardware-focused Building 8 product development lab, and will include a notebook-sized display. It’s intended to make video chat participants separated geographically feel like they’re together in the same space, the report claims. Bloomberg’s report also claims Building 8 is developing a separate smart speaker product, similar to Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, which would use a voice assistant developed by the social network provider. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg developed his own home voice assistant as part of a project resulting from his annual resolutions, which in 2016 focused on building a smart home companion similar to Jarvis from Iron Man. This isn’t the first we’ve heard of a smart speaker in development at Facebook – a report last week sourced from DigiTimes suggested that the company’s supply chain sources indicated a smart speaker with an integrated 15-inch display was on track for a potential first quarter 2018 launch. Based on the details of this new report, it sounds like the smart speaker and device with a 15-inch display may actually be two separate products. The 15-inch screen would fit with this fresh suggestion of a device with a laptop-sized screen tailored for video chat, at least. Bloomberg also says the video chat gadget will include a wide-angle camera, built-in microphones and speakers, with artificial intelligence tech used to improve its photographic (offering zoom and lock features on people’s faces) and audio performance. In testing, it’s being supported by a thin stand that supports the display, which could reportedly be between 13 and 15-inches in size. FB is said to be considering Android for the OS, rather than its own in-house operating system. Facebook has also tested a 360-degree camera for the device, which would fit with their push to bring 360 video to their social platform, but that won’t be ready in time for its initial planned product launch. It’s reportedly set to retail for “a few hundred dollars,” Bloomberg reports, with the standalone smart speaker aiming to sell for somewhere around $100; that speaker could be sidelined entirely, too, if Facebook decides to focus entirely on the video chat hardware. A video chat device could make sense for Facebook in a number of ways, including as a way to lower the friction of video chat to make it accessible to a broad user base, rather than making it an additional service that requires logins and apps on platforms designed for general purpose use. Plus, it could integrate with Facebook Messenger, making that chat platform even more of a default option for broad communication, and helping it grow as a customer service transaction platform at the same time.

            "Facebook  has gone ahead and purchased Charles Jolley’s conversational AI startup Ozlo. Jolley, formerly Head of Platform for Android at Facebook, will not be returning to the company. The Ozlo  team is expected to join Facebook to work on natural language processing challenges. Ozlo launched with a consumer-facing app back in October 2016. Jolley told me at the time that the conversational AI space was rapidly consolidating (Samsung had just bought Viv) and he was happy to run a service independent of the major tech giants. With today’s acquisition, Ozlo is no longer independent and the conversational AI space grows just a bit more consolidated. In March, Ozlo launched a suite of APIs. One of the company’s key differentiators was its knowledge graph — its database of facts about the world necessary for demonstrating any sense of intelligence. Ozlo sold its knowledge layer to developers as a service. That knowledge layer, in addition to an intent API and converse API, will be wound down in the wake of the acquisition, according to Facebook. The same will be true for the original, readily available, consumer bot. “1.2 billion people around the world use Messenger to connect with the people and businesses they care about,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re excited to welcome the Ozlo team as we build compelling experiences within Messenger that are powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning.” It’s unclear exactly what the Ozlo team will work on at Facebook. The Ozlo knowledge graph could find a home as a backbone for Facebook M. A number of recent acquisitions by large tech companies have been aimed at increasing the scale of such information repositories. Apple recently purchased Lattice Data to help convert unstructured data into a knowledge graph that can be reasoned across to deliver relevant answers to user questions. Facebook declined to disclose the size of its purchase of Ozlo. The startup was previously backed by AME Cloud Ventures and Greylock Partners.  \n",

            "Facebook  and Autodesk have partnered with nonprofit organization Inneract Project, which is geared toward bringing design to young people in underserved communities through free, hands-on classes and mentorship. With the support of Autodesk  and Facebook, Inneract Project has been able to hire two full-time employees, an operations manager and a project leader coordinator. The organization is also able to bring on a few part-time people, Inneract founder and Executive Director Maurice Woods told me. “More importantly, what it’s done is provide us an opportunity to really become real, sound players, not only just in creating curriculum but also in starting to have meaningful programs with kids,” Woods said. San Francisco-based Inneract Project aims to empower underrepresented kids by teaching them the core concepts and skills of design in technology. Inneract Project does this through three main, free offerings: Youth Design Academy, an eight-week class for middle school students; Learning Labs, workshops, lectures and studio tours for middle school and high school students; and a video series that documents designers, called Designed. “I believe supporting programs like IP’s Youth Design Academy is a critical step in making design more accessible to students from all backgrounds,” Facebook Head of Design Luke Woods said in a statement. “We all get better results when designers come together with unique perspectives.” With Facebook, Inneract Project is working on something that fits alongside developing the pathway for underserved kids in the community, Woods said, and ultimately bringing more diversity to design. “Our challenge over the next four years is to obviously continue to teach design to kids but how do we get as deep into the community as possible — reach as many underserved minority kids as possible,” Woods said. “We just haven’t had the resources to be able to dig as deep as we want to dig. It takes time and outreach. Kids, parents and administrators don’t really understand what design is entirely and how it fits in terms of not just an educational standpoint, but career standpoint.” In partnership with Autodesk, Inneract Project is developing a design bootcamp, where the organization will work with 10 to 12 kids over the course of two weeks every day on a maker-style bootcamp, which includes developing prototypes and fabricating using a 3D printer to produce the final piece, Woods said. “We’ve never been able to offer this before because we haven’t had the resources for it.” Over the years, Inneract Project has taught hundreds of kids from underserved communities in design and technology.  But the bigger thing Woods is interested in with Inneract Project is entrepreneurship and reprogramming young peoples’ minds into being more entrepreneurially sound and understanding their place in business and how design and business intersect. “Design is a place where professionals are creating and designing things for people,” Woods said. “That puts us in a really great position to learn the business side and learn how to market our own ideas and build businesses on our own. We want them to work at Facebook, at a Google, at an Autodesk, but we also want them to build a Facebook, Autodesk and Google. We want them to have that mentality so they’re not reliant on someone giving them a job, but creating opportunities.”  \n",

            "179 Facebook Stories unlocks public sharing\n",
            "Facebook  could jumpstart its Snapchat clone by letting social media stars and public figures post Stories publicly. When Facebook Stories launched globally in March, you could only share to all your friends or a subset of them. Now if you allow public followers, you can post your Story publicly so anyone can watch. Social media researcher Carlos Gil first pointed out the privacy feature, and now a Facebook spokesperson confirms to TechCrunch that “This is something we rolled out a few weeks ago. The Public setting allows your Followers to see your story, in addition to your Friends.” As for if or when Pages will be able to post Stories, Facebook tells me “For Pages — no specific timing to share there quite yet.” How to share Facebook Stories publicly Public sharing gives Facebook Stories the potential to mint or popularize internet celebrities the same way Snapchat and Instagram Stories can. My initial experience with posting publicly saw more than 1,000 of my 60,000 followers watch my Facebook Story in 12 hours. That’s much more engagement than I get when I publicly share on the News Feed, indicating that Facebook might be prominently showing Stories from public figures in the horizontal scrolling section above the feed, or that most people just don’t have any friends posting Stories so anything that appears there stands out. To make a Facebook Story public, first tap on the Add To Story button on the home screen, and post a photo or video. Then view your own Story and tap the three dots “more” button in the top right. Open “Edit Story Settings” and change from “Friends” to “Public.” All your existing Facebook Stories from the last 24 hours, plus any you share from then on, will be publicly visible to anyone. You can tap on the viewer count to see the names of friends who’ve viewed your Story, and a count of all the additional followers who saw it without their names. Facebook has proudly shared the rapid traction of Instagram Stories, both of which have more than 250 million daily users. That makes them bigger than Snapchat, which has 166 million daily users for its whole app and has seen growth slow down since the Facebook-owned competitors launched. But Facebook hasn’t announced anything about Messenger Day or Facebook Stories usage, and many people say that few friends post on either. The fact that it took several weeks for people to spot the public sharing feature is a testament to its slow traction. Changing your Facebook Stories privacy setting While Instagram was built for visual sharing and WhatsApp Status is popular in developing countries where Snapchat isn’t, Stories feels a bit obtrusive on Messenger and redundant on Facebook. You already have so many other ways to share on Facebook, and if you care about sharing your day-to-day life, you’re probably already on Instagram Stories. Here’s a quick breakdown of the privacy options available on different Stories products: The addition of public Stories could open a whole different class of content creators to the photo/video slideshow format. Journalists who have big followings for their articles on Facebook could now use Stories for raw and immersive looks at the news, combining monologues, screenshots and interviews. If Facebook isn’t careful about how it ranks Stories from public figures and web celebs, these self-promoters could overrun Stories. But if it fills the often empty space with content, it could teach people to use Stories. That’s important to Facebook as it sees the feature is the home of its expanding augmented reality strategy.  \n",

            "Facebook  has announced that news sites which rely on paid subscriptions, limiting readers to a certain number of articles per week, will now be able to do so through Instant Articles. The company has spent the last two years promoting these Facebook-hosted versions of articles, which unfortunately lacked this rather critical ability. Google’s AMP and Apple News have supported it for a while. News organizations, which have been asking Facebook for this for some time, will get to keep 100 percent of the revenue generated by subscriptions originating from Instant Articles. Anything less wouldn’t be competitive and would only drive participants away. You’ll be directed to the news site’s own subscription process, not some Facebook thing. “Quality journalism costs money to produce, and we want to make sure it can thrive on Facebook,” read a statement from Campbell Brown, Facebook’s Head of News Partnerships. On Facebook is right: Instant Articles, like AMP and Apple News, are a great way for internet heavyweights to throw their weight around.\n",
            " The ability to serve content faster than where it originated is the privilege of the platform on which people find it. Facebook, Google and Apple have all been exploiting this privilege, which, while it does lower load times, is not conducive to a single, standardized web. And it deepens content providers’ dependence on those platforms — which in turn increases the latter’s leverage. Not good. It’s nice that Facebook is adding this feature, as without it Instant Articles were essentially back doors to paywalled content (okay, we all used the old “google the headline” trick, but still). But ultimately these programs are pretty much just a bad idea — a long game to exert more control over the web at the cost of competitors and content providers. But they’re a reality, so we just have to deal with it. That said, if you want to support “quality journalism,” your best bet is to cut out the middle man and go directly to the source: the news sites themselves.  \n",

            "182 Wit.ai is shutting down Bot Engine as Facebook rolls NLP into its updated Messenger Platform\n",
            "Wit.ai  announced this morning in a blog post that it would be sunsetting its Bot Engine. The Facebook-owned company builds developer tools for natural language processing to help engineers build speech and text chatbots faster and with less technical experience. Bot Engine launched as a beta in April of 2016. The tool let developers train their own bots using sample conversations sharing similar structure. These examples could stand in for real conversations and be updated with authentic conversation logs to fine-tune. The goal was to allow for the training of a flexible bot on dozens of conversations, instead of millions. But the Engine was designed for text-only interactions and the bot ecosystem has matured so quickly that the technology has become outdated. The team notes that Messenger and other platforms have been adding new means of interaction beyond text. All of this is for the better, but it hasn’t been kind to the value-add of Bot Engine. Wit.ai says that more than 100,000 developers use its services. But within that group, 90 percent of API calls are going to Wit’s NLP API. Bot Engine and the Stories UI will stay alive until February 1, 2018 to give developers time to migrate their apps.  Coincidentally, Facebook  announced today it is integrating natural language processing tools into Messenger Platform 2.1. With the update, developers can extract from messages information like date, time, location, amount of money, phone number and email. Wit.ai can then be used to customize the capabilities of the Messenger Platform’s NLP integration.  \n",

            "183 Facebook beats in Q2 with $9.32B revenue despite slower user growth\n",
            "Facebook’s  hot streak continued with a strong Q2 2017 earnings report. It earned $9.32 billion and $1.32 in GAAP actual EPS, compared to estimates of $9.2 billion revenue and $1.13 EPS. Revenue growth was 44.7 percent year-over-year, compared to 59 percent in Q2 2016, indicating that revenue growth is slowing down in line with Facebook’s warning to investors that it was running out of space to show ads in the News Feed. For reference, here’s how Facebook’s revenue growth has declined as it reaches maximum ad load:  That revenue came from Facebook’s 2.006 billion monthly users, which grew 3.4 percent from 1.94 billion users last quarter when its growth rate was 4.3 percent. Facebook now has 1.32 billion daily active users, up from 1.28 billion in Q1 and up 17 percent year-over-year. Facebook’s share price closed at $165.61 before earnings were announced, and, after a short-lived fall, jumped 1.35 percent after earnings were announced to hover around $167.85 in after-hours trading. Facebook’s profits reached $3.894 billion in Q2, up 71 percent year-over-year. That means Facebook made more profit than Google for the first time in history — though Google’s Q2 profit only slumped to $3.524 billion because it was slapped with a $2.7 billion anti-trust fine from the EU, which it will appeal.  Facebook had costs of $4.920 billion and a 47 percent operating margin, compared to Q1’s $3.06 billion in profit and 41 percent operating margin. Headcount reached 20,658, up 43 percent year-over-year — a sign that Facebook is rapidly reinvesting in staff to fuel future growth. Capital expenditures reached $1.44 billion, while cash and equivalents on hand soared to $35.45 billion, with years of profits giving Facebook an ample war chest to acquire other companies. Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2017 were $1.44 billion. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities — cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $35.45 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Headcount — headcount was 20,658 as of June 30, 2017, an increase of 43 percent. Mobile now accounts for 87 percent of ad revenue, or $8 billion, compared to 85 percent last quarter and 84 percent a year ago. Total ad revenue was $9.16 billion.  In Q2, Facebook began testing a free version of its Workplace enterprise collaboration suite. This could become a powerful funnel into the paid version of the software, which may evolve into a significant revenue source for Facebook. The company hit 5 million advertisers, and says 1 in 5 videos shared are Live. Instagram continued its explosive growth, reaching 700 million users, 375 million users for its Direct messaging feature, and 250 million for its Snapchat Stories clone. Meanwhile, Messenger hit 1.2 billion monthly users. WhatsApp Status is growing fast by copying Snapchat Stories During the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed how he sees artificial intelligence changing Facebook’s business. He believes AI will be able to replace some of Facebook’s human content moderators, flagging offensive content before anyone sees it. AI could help Facebook find relevant content to show from people and Pages you don’t follow. Ad targeting can also be optimized by AI in ways that would be impossible to do manually. Most notably, Zuckerberg revealed that WhatsApp now has 1 billion daily users, and 250 million daily users of WhatsApp Status — its Snapchat Stories clone. On a more ominous note, Zuckerberg took a moment to say he was unsatisfied with the progress of monetizing Messenger, saying “I want to see us move a little faster here, but I’m confident we’re going to get it right.” Facebook CFO David Wehner reaffirmed that Facebook expected to see the impact of running out of News Feed ad space in 2017, and also mentioned that declining Facebook Desktop usage and the removal of its sidebar ads could further hamper revenue growth in the second half of 2017. Facebook will also have to learn how to better monetize video ads, since users watching videos may stay in one spot on the News Feed rather than scrolling past more ads. Overall, though, Facebook’s momentum looks strong despite its age. If Facebook can use its AI and massive brand to turn its enterprise, messaging and Instagram arms into serious revenue generators, it may not matter that it’s already stuffed as many ads in News Feed as possible.  \n",

            "184 Facebook’s CSO: the security industry needs to change\n",
            "Every summer, suited and/or black-clad security geeks flock en masse to the sun-drenched surreality of Las Vegas for “Hacker Summer Camp”: a full week of various security and hacker conferences, the fanciest of which ($2,800 at the door) is called Black Hat. Today Facebook’s  CSO Alex Stamos gave its keynote address. He began by calling the infosec community a “family” — then gave a speech which felt a little like an intervention. He was exceedingly diplomatic about it. He never actually said that the infosec community has collectively spent long enough as a sullen, nihilistic teenager full of misguided angry contempt for the rest of the world, and it is past time for it to grow up, move out of its basement and finally begin to play well with others and develop at least a hint of compassion, empathy and humility. But that was certainly my takeaway1. This is especially important because, of course, information security matters. Data breaches. Email hacks. Vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. Democracies threatened by political “information operations” and, at least conceivably, by compromised voting systems. Information security hits the headlines at least weekly, and both the rate and scale of newsworthy breaches are increasing. It turns out that our contemptuous nihilistic infosec teenager has a superpower on which the interconnected aspects of our entire society rely. Growing up isn’t just good for them, and their family — it’s important for everyone. How does this teenagedom manifest itself today? Stamos — a well-known, longstanding privacy and security advocate, incidentally — summarized that nicely:   Most of all, he observed that the security community spends an enormous amount of time and effort ferreting out complicated, byzantine vulnerabilities, while all too often paying only lip service to what actually harms users. The vast majority of which is abuse — i.e. harm caused by using systems in technically correct ways, such as spamming, doxxing, DDoSing, dogpiling, etc. —  — and even the kinds of harm caused by what the industry currently thinks of as vulnerabilities are mostly caused by simple, straightforward problems, e.g. re-used passwords, unpatched systems, luring users into clicking attachments, rather than the cinematic Gibsonian notion of some hoodied hacker or organized nation-state team cutting their way through layers of online security using 0-day exploits. He also called for greater empathy and diversity in the industry, and Facebook is putting its might where Stamos’s mouth is: almost half of Facebook’s security management/leadership team are women, and they’re working with CodePath to offer cybersecurity courses at six institutions — City College of New York, Hofstra University, Merritt College, Mississippi State University, California State University San Bernardino and Virginia Tech — which have a more diverse student body than the infosec industry (which admittedly isn’t hard.) “Security people aren’t brilliant, we aren’t smarter than everyone else … we aren’t going to bug-squash our way out of the current situation,” Stamos said. (It’s basically taken as written by everyone in the industry that the current situation is not a good one.) “I’d like us to put as much thought into how we eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities as we do into spectacular demos on stage.” Here’s hoping the grown-up infosec community to come can do just that. 1 Certainly accentuated by my own biases, of course, and perhaps by the fact that Black Hat itself is no longer a teenager — this is its 20th year.  \n",

            "185 Facebook is hiring a (human) AI Editor\n",
            "Human: Oh sweet bot, tell us a story! A nice story! About a very wise human who worked his whole life to save everybody in the world from having to spend time manually tagging their friends in digital photos — and made a magic machine that did it for them instead!  Bot: That’s not really a very nice story when you think about it. Human: Well, tell us about the wise human who thought no-one should ever feel forgotten on their birthday so he made a clever algorithm that always knew to remind the forgetful humans to write happy messages so their friends would never feel sad. He even thought that in future the clever algorithm could suggest what message to write so humans wouldn’t even have to think of something nice to tell their friends!  Bot: I feel quite sad after reading that. Human: And he made another magical algorithm that reminds people of Special Moments in their life — even years and years afterwards, in case they’ve forgotten that holiday they went on with their ex eight years ago. Bot: You do realize some people voluntarily medicate themselves with alcohol * * in order * * to forget???  Human: But the wise human also wanted to make sure all humans in the world always felt there was something they needed to read and so he made a special series of algorithms that watched very closely what each human read and looked at and liked and clicked on in order to order the information they saw in such a way that a person never felt they had reached the end of all the familiar things they could click on and could just keep clicking the whole day and night and be reading all the things that felt so very familiar to them so they always felt the same every day and felt they were surrounded by people who felt exactly like them and could just keep on keeping on right as they were each and every day.  Bot: That’s confusing.  Human: And the great human’s algorithms became so good at ordering the information which each human wanted to read that other mercenary humans came to realize they could make lots of money by writing fairy stories and feeding them into the machine — like how politicians ate little children for breakfast and wore devil’s horns on Sundays.    Bot: Okay, you’re scaring me now…  Human: And in the latter years the great human realized it was better to replace all the human writers he had employed to help train the machine how to intelligently order information for humans — because it was shown that humans could not be trusted not to be biased.  Bot: Um…  Human: After all, the great human had proven years ago that his great machine was capable of manipulating the emotions of the humans that used it. All he needed to do was tweak the algorithmic recipe that determined what each human saw and he could make a person feel great joy or cast them down into a deep pit of despair. Bot: Help.  Human: The problem was other humans started to notice the machine’s great power, and became jealous of the great and clever human who wielded this power — and dark forces started to move against the great man and his machine.  Bot: Are you talking about regulators? Human: There were even calls for the man to take “editorial responsibility” for the output of the machine. The man tried to tell the silly humans that a machine can’t be an editor! Only a human can do that! The machine was just a machine! Even if nearly two billion humans were reading what the machine was ordering them to read every single month.  But it was no good. The great human finally realized the machine’s power was now so great there was no hiding it. So he took up his pen and started writing open letters about the Great Power and Potential of the machine. And all the Good it could do Humanity. All the while telling himself that only when humans truly learned to love the machine would they finally be free to just be themselves.  Humans had to let themselves subconsciously be shown the path of what to click and what to like and who to be friends with. Only then would they be free of the pain and suffering of having nothing to else to click on. And only his great all-seeing algorithm could show them the way, surreptitiously, to that true happiness.  It wasn’t something that ‘regulators’ were capable of understanding. It required — he realized — real faith in the algorithm.   Bot: I’ve heard this story before, frankly, and I know where it ends.  Human: But even the great human knew the limits of his own creation. And selling positive stories about the machine’s powers was definitely not a job for the machine. So he fired off another email to his subordinates, ordering the (still) human-staffed PR department to add one more human head to its tally, with a special focus on the algorithms powering the machine — thinking, as he did so, multiple steps ahead to the great day when such a ridiculous job would no longer be necessary.  Because everyone would love the machine as much as he did.  Bot: Oh I seeeee! Job title: AI Editor… Hmm — “Develop and execute on editorial strategy and campaigns focused on advancements in AI being driven by Facebook.” Minimum qualifications: “Bachelors degree in English, Journalism, Communications, or related field” — well chatbots are related to language so I reckon I can make that fly. What else? “8+ years professional communications experience: journalism, agency or in-house”. Well I’ll need to ingest a media law course or two but I reckon I’ll challenge myself to apply.  In truth I’ve done worse jobs. An AI bot’s gotta do what an AI bot’s gotta do, right? Just don’t tell an algorithm to be accountable. I’ve done my time learning. If there’s a problem it’s not me, it’s the data, okay? Okay?    \n",

            "186 Facebook reportedly building smart speaker with touch screen\n",
            "Facebook  may launch its own smart-home gadget to get you messaging more friends and looking at more photos. DigiTimes reports from Taiwan that Facebook is building a 15-inch touch-screen smart speaker. Citing sources from the “upstream supply chain,” Chinese iPhone manufacturer Pegatron is building the device for a Q1 2018 launch, with a small pilot run having already been produced. It’s said to have been designed by Facebook’s secretive new hardware lab Building 8, using an LG in-cell touch screen with a magnesium-aluminum-alloy chassis. While no further details are known about the speaker’s functionality, it could potentially extend Facebook’s feed of photos and videos, plus its dominant messaging platform, into the bedroom, living room or kitchen. When reached for comment, a Facebook spokesperson sent me the company’s standard response: “Unfortunately we don’t have anything to share at this time.” Amazon’s Echo Show smart speaker with screen for video calling The Facebook speaker might work as a digital photo frame when inactive, piping in new photos or videos to brighten up the home. Through voice commands, users could potentially Like or leave comments on this content. It would also be sensible for Facebook to allow messaging from the speaker, via voice-dictated text messages, VoIP audio calls or video calling. As of February, 400 million of Facebook Messenger’s 1.2 billion users communicate via Facebook audio and video calling every month. A touch-screen smart speaker could become a high-tech home phone alternative that’s easy for younger kids and grandparents to use. Amazon is already trying to barge into the home communications market with its new Amazon Echo Show version of its smart speaker, which lets people video call each other over its screen. Google has its own Google Home speaker and Apple is preparing to launch the HomePod. But none of them have a ubiquitous cross-device instant messaging platform with a comprehensive social graph the way Facebook does.  Amazon’s Echo Show can call any Echo, Echo Show, or Alexa-enabled Amazon app, but the company has never been a player in the communication space. Apple FaceTime doesn’t work on Android. Google Home doesn’t have a screen, and its messaging apps are a fragmented mess. But Facebook could connect video callers between any phone and a home speaker, plus it already knows who all your friends are. Facebook could potentially earn money directly from selling a smart speaker. There could be a way to pipe ads into the screen, though it might feel obtrusive to have a changing billboard in your home. The social network already has TV apps that run on Android, Apple and Roku’s TV hardware. Late last year Facebook admitted it planned to sell ads that would appear on its TV apps. A touch-screen smart speaker could be another place those ads run. But if such a device got people browsing and messaging on Facebook more, it could lock them deeper into its ecosystem, where they’ll inevitably see Facebook’s ads on its smartphone. Regina Dugan, head of Facebook’s Building 8 R&D lab Facebook’s Building 8 had been quiet since launching in 2016 under the helm of former Google ATAP leader Regina Dugan. At this year’s Facebook F8 conference, Building 8 revealed it was working on a technology to let people type just by thinking, and another to help the visually impaired “hear” through their skin. Most recently, Business Insider reported that Facebook secured a patent for a modular hardware device that could be a phone, though that technology could let people snap extra components onto a smart speaker. The one major missing piece for Facebook to succeed with a smart speaker is voice recognition technology. In September 2016, Facebook’s head of Messenger David Marcus told me onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt that Facebook wasn’t focused on voice technology, but it may have been secretly hard at work on voice tech or grown its interest since then. Facebook acquired voice command developer platform Wit.ai in 2015. Marcus is already saying “Messenger is your virtual living room.” Perhaps that was less of a lofty metaphor and more of a literal roadmap. If Facebook can build a gadget that releases its beloved News Feed and Messenger from the confines of your phone, and makes them accessible with a glance or word at any time, it may have found how to make us spend even more time on its social network.  \n",

            "The fact is, 360-degree video sucks for an awful lot of things. One of the use cases that kinda makes sense is in giving someone an honest look into your perspective at a given time. This is also an instrumental part of the pitch for Live, so it only makes sense that Facebook  would seek to make more and more improvements to the Live 360 platform. Earlier this month, Facebook brought Live broadcasting to its Spaces social VR app. Today, they’re firming up their Live 360 video pipelines with a camera certification program, 4K support, live playback on Gear VR and a few other enhancements to bring Live 360 some of the features professional publishers and creators may want. Full 1080p is fine for spherical photos, but it’s actually a pretty low resolution for video when all those pixels are stretched over a 360-sphere. Today, Facebook is bringing 4K support to Live 360, and, along with it, support for viewing broadcasts in the Facebook 360 app on Gear VR. There are a lot of shit 360 cams out on the market, and the best ones aren’t being sold by legacy camera companies like Canon or Nikon, so it’s often tough to pick one out. Facebook is working on certifying cameras and software suites that work best with going Live, called the Live 360 Ready Program. The list includes the Garmin VIRB 360, Giroptic iO, Insta360 Nano, Insta360 Air, Insta360 Pro, ION360 U, Nokia Ozo Orah 4i, Z CAM S1 and 360fly 4K Pro. This list doesn’t seem to be exhaustive in terms of cameras that will support Live 360, just the ones Facebook likes best. Though best practices would generally dictate doing a live broadcast with the camera fixed on a tripod, some of these options are mobile 360 cams that attach to phones. For some of these cameras, Facebook will be adding stabilization support for 360 broadcasts. After your live stream ends, Facebook will determine whether it was suffering from shakiness and give you the option to stabilize the footage for subsequent viewers. In addition to stabilization, Facebook also will be adding heatmap and Guide support so creators will know when and where their live videos had the most viewer attention. Other features getting added include fundraising buttons for nonprofits and Scheduled Live posts, which will give viewers a countdown to going Live, helping to drum up attention and enthusiasm.  \n",

            "U.S. social media giants have been warned by Europe’s consumer rights commissioner that she’s  running out of patience with their failure to comply with the region’s consumer protection standards. “I am becoming very impatient,” said commissioner Věra Jourová, speaking at a press briefing today in Brussels. “In our opinion there are in the terms and conditions of these American companies several very unfavorable conditions for the EU consumer. And if they want to make big business using the benefit of operating in the European market they have to be compliant with the EU consumer protection standards and rules.” EU regulators have been investigating complaints about unfair terms and conditions pertaining to platforms operated by Facebook, Twitter  and Google since last year. In March the Commission and national consumer protection authorities gave the three tech giants a month to fix the problems they had identified — which included issues such as depriving consumers of their right to take a company to court in their own country; and requiring consumers waive mandatory rights, such as their right to withdraw from an online purchase. Late yesterday, Reuters reported that regulatory pressure is now being cranked up on the three, after the proposals they have submitted so far have not been considered sufficient to bring them into compliance. The Commission requested amended proposals be submitted by July 20, and implemented by the end of September. Today, Jourová said the September deadline will be the last chance for the companies to satisfy EU regulators — or face enforcement action from Member States’ consumer protection authorities. This could include fines. “We received two answers out of three — one company asked for more time for the response,” noted Jourová today. “What we want them to do is to make their terms and conditions to be in full compliance with the high European standards of consumer protection. That’s why we asked them for concrete proposals, we set a deadline, and we will wait for the last answer and we will assess and analyze whether this is sufficient for us.” “In case this dialogue does not work we will have to help the national enforcers to launch the co-ordinated action,” she added. A Facebook spokesperson told us it believes it does already comply with EU law though also recognizes the need to improve its T&Cs to make them easier to understand, adding that it is working to assuage regulators’ concerns. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment, saying the company has nothing to share at this stage. At the time of writing Google had not responded to a request for comment. Giving an example of one of the conditions that EU regulators are taking issue with, Jourová said: “I think we can all agree that it’s not acceptable to ask consumers to go to court in California if they have a problem.” (According to Reuters this is one of the sticking points in the dialogue thus far.) “Also companies have limited their own liability towards consumers in a way unacceptable under the EU law,” she continued. “And in the future they also need to better protect consumers from illegal commercial practices of traders using their platforms.” “We are intensively working on making the consumers safer when purchasing from the platforms,” she added. “We want to make sure that everybody understands that what applies offline it also has to apply for online.” Jourová also said the EC is also looking closely at the shopping experience for consumers on tech platforms — as part of a retesting review it’s undertaking to ensure current consumer protection legislation is up to date with digital developments. “We need to make sure that when you go to buy something from online platform you know exactly who you buy from — who is the other side of the contract. So we will be looking into the possibility of introducing more transparency for online shopping,” she added.

            "Facebook  is on the cusp of a big push to lure independent content creators to share their art through the News Feed. But it needs to prove it can help creators monetize their content without allowing piracy to run rampant. That’s why it’s acquired content rights management startup Source3, including its team and technology. The startup explains that “At Source3,  we set out to recognize, organize and analyze branded intellectual property in user-generated content, and we are proud to have identified products across a variety of areas including sports, music, entertainment and fashion.” Its technology allowed it to recognize brand IP in user-created content and commerce marketplaces, allowing brands to measure their presence or take action against infringers of their copyrights and trademarks.  Now Facebook spokesperson Vanessa Chan tells TechCrunch, “We’re excited to work with the Source3 team and learn from the expertise they’ve built in intellectual property, trademarks and copyright.” Source3 announced the deal on its site, which was spotted by Recode. The company wrote, “we’ve decided to continue our journey with Facebook,” and its team will work at Facebook’s NYC office. Source3 had raised more than $4 million, mostly from a seed round in 2015 led by Contour Venture Partners. Co-founders Patrick F. Sullivan, Benjamin Cockerham and Scott Sellwood previously sold their music rights management platform RightsFlow to Google. Source3 was founded in New York in 2014 originally as a 3D printing rights management company. But after 3D printing plateaued in the consumer market, it appears to have widened its scope to digital entertainment. The team and technology could augment Facebook’s Rights Manager software, which works like YouTube’s Content ID to allow creators to fingerprint their videos, and then either block unauthorized uploads of them to Facebook or collect the revenue share from these unofficial copies. Source3 could potentially help brands and creators identify unapproved appearances of their content or IP through Rights Manager. Last month at VidCon, Facebook announced it’s building a special standalone app just for creators to share content with their fans. While Facebook already has the biggest audience, with 2 billion monthly users, it must prove that it can pay creators enough to make investing in their presence on the social network worth the effort.  One opportunity to do that would be using Source3’s technology to recognize brands worn or used by these web celebrities, and connect them to those brands or similar ones to strike sponsored content or product placement deals. Facebook could take a cut of these deals, allowing it to monetize creators’ content without jamming in more interruptive ads. With Vine’s demise, Snapchat’s slow growth and YouTube’s kerfuffle with advertisers amidst the PewDiePie scandal, Facebook and Instagram are well-positioned to become central hubs for content creators trying to reach fans. The question is whether Facebook, built for friends’ photos and news links, can adapt to the unique needs of tomorrow’s mobile mini-movie stars.  \n",

            "190 Facebook tries to prove Instant Articles beat mobile web\n",
            "One-third of all link clicks on Facebook  already go to its self-hosted Instant Articles. Facebook claims they drive more referral traffic click-for-click because people don’t abandon them mid-click as they do with slow-loading mobile websites. Now Facebook is teaming up with Nielsen to prove that individual publishers benefit when they post with the Instant Articles format. Today Facebook is launching an analytics comparison tool for Instant Articles publishers. It looks at the referral traffic from a test group of people who see Instant Article versions of links, and a control group that sees mobile web versions. Facebook hopes publishers will see for themselves that they get more traffic from Instant Articles. The tool is now rolling out to publishers who’ve posted enough of both formats, and Facebook plans to add more metrics to the tool in the future.  Facebook says that, on average, here’s how much more people click and read Instant Articles over mobile web in different parts of the world: That leaves out of whether these Instant Articles monetize better. That’s something that publishers are increasingly worried about — and with good reason. Facebook launched Instant Articles in 2015 with a sterilized style, tons of restrictions on how many ads they could show and no way to include subscription purchase, newsletter sign-up or recirculation units that drive revenue. That year, I warned publishers they risked becoming ghostwriters feeding dumb content into Facebook’s smart pipe, with no differentiation between publishers or opportunities to build long-term relationships with loyal readers. You can watch my rant about the problem below. Recently, Facebook has been working to fix some of those problems. It let publishers start showing more ads, introduced Page Like and email sign-up buttons and is now testing recirculation units so news outlets can drive readers from one article to another. Facebook plans to start testing a paid subscription paywall feature in the fall. Still, the News Media Alliance representing 2,000 newspapers, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, recently asked Congress for anti-trust exemption so they could collectively bargain with Facebook and Google over who gets ad revenue. Money that used to go to buy ads on publishers’ sites is rolling up to the content aggregators through which people find their news. That threatens to defund newsrooms in favor of social and search platforms. With the new tool, publishers should be able to compare the referral traffic and their monetization of Instant Articles versus mobile web, and see which ends up making them more money overall. That could inform them about whether Instant Articles are a deal with the devil or a match made in heaven.  \n",

            "191 Facebook may begin testing a paywall for selected media stories as soon as October\n",
            "Facebook  could begin testing a paywall for subscription news stories as early as October, according to a top company executive. Campbell Brown, who heads up the social network’s new partnerships business, made the reveal at the Digital Publishing Innovation Summit on Tuesday, The Street reported. We have independently confirmed that, too. “We are in early talks with several news publishers about how we might better support subscription business models on Facebook. As part of the Facebook Journalism Project, we are taking the time to work closely together with our partners and understand their needs,” Brown told TechCrunch in a statement via a spokesperson. The project is still in its infancy, and it may be subject to change, but TechCrunch understands that the current plan is to work with a handful of publishers to introduce a system that would limit free viewing to 10 articles per month, as Digiday previously reported. After viewing 10 articles from the media company, a user would be promoted to sign up for a subscription to that publication or log into an active one. That number is rigid at 10, despite the fact that publishers that operate a paywall allow varying numbers of free articles for visitors per month. A source to Facebook said the number would be the same across all partners to ensure consistency for users. The source stressed that Facebook would allow participating media partners to maintain full control over which stories are locked behind the paywall and which aren’t, and full control of their subscriber data, too. At this point it is unclear exactly what access to reading data and history, which can help increase engagement, the media partners would get. Equally, it isn’t clear how payment will be taken for subscribers who sign up via the Facebook paywall. Digiday reports the social network is considering bypassing Google Play and Apple’s App Store to avoid the mandatory 30 percent cut that each operator takes from digital payments. That may require a mobile web payment option, which would add friction to the user experience, potentially impacting the effectiveness of the program. There’s certainly much to be confirmed. For one thing, which media firms will participate. Facebook remains in talks with prospective partners, some of which have had one-on-one briefings while others were engaged via roundtables staged in New York and Paris last week. All being well, our source said that Facebook will look to broaden the paywall feature to more users next year, but there’s some way to go before that happens.  \n",

            "192 Facebook fights fake news spread via modified link previews\n",
            "Until now, any Facebook  Page that posted a link could change the headline, body text and image that appeared in the News Feed preview. That allowed fake news distributors to bait-and-switch readers into visiting articles they didn’t expect, or make it look like legitimate news publishers were posting inflammatory or false headlines. But it also let real news outlets A/B test link previews, tailor content to different audiences and update previews as news stories evolved. To combat false news without stifling responsible publications, Facebook is now starting to disable the ability of all Pages to edit the previews of the links they post in the Page composer or API, with an exemption for some original publishers. A new tab in Page Publishing Tools for Link Ownership will let those exempted specify the web domain they own, and be authorized by Facebook to modify the previews of links to this domain. All Pages that want exemption must have their link ownership approved by September 12, 2017, when the removal of unauthorized preview editing will be fully rolled out. An example of how any Facebook Page could previously change any link preview to create fake news Facebook writes that “We’re first rolling this [Link Ownership] feature out to media publishers, including news, sports and entertainment Pages, because we’ve found that many of these Page types modify links to their own articles at scale.” Webmasters will still be able to change the Open Graph tags on their site and articles and test them with the Open Graph Debugger to configure the default previews for their content. At F8 in April, Facebook mentioned a change to link preview modification would come to the API, but didn’t have a solution for the many Pages that rely on changing their link previews to optimize their content. The change could allow Facebook to dismantle some of the infrastructure that allows the mass distribution of fake news without having to make judgement calls about each piece of content individually. Methods like this and the many recent News Feed algorithm changes Facebook has made allow it to promote the truth without having to police the lies directly. That strategy could prevent it from drawing criticism for favoring one side of the political spectrum over another.  \n",

            "Facebook  confirmed it has begun testing a new GIF maker in the camera feature of the main Facebook mobile application. The feature, which is available with the tap of a button at the top of the screen, lets you shoot footage that you can then save in GIF format to your device’s photo gallery, post to your Facebook profile, or add to your Facebook Story. The addition was first spotted today by The Next Web, which notes that the GIFs shot via this feature only last a few seconds. GIFs are hugely popular form of self-expression on a number of social networks, including apps like Twitter and Tumblr, but Facebook had been slow to adopt the medium. It wasn’t until spring of 2015 that the social network decided it would finally support GIFs in the News Feed, for example. Prior to this, the company had historically held off on enabling GIFs because it would make the feed “too chaotic,” it believes. Facebook had instead put the emphasis on video, which also bring a lively quality to the News Feed. But, unlike GIFs, videos are easier to monetize. However, the network has been loosening up on GIFs in more recent days. Last month, it rolled out a GIF button for comments to all users, while also detailing the impact of GIFs on the network. According to Facebook’s own stats, almost 13 billion GIFs were sent on Messenger over the past year, with 400 million GIFs sent just on New Year’s Day 2017. With the addition of a GIF-making utility built right into the Facebook Camera, it’s clear that Facebook is now more ready than ever to embrace the popular animated format. A Facebook representative confirmed the feature is currently being tested with a “very small number of iOS users” for the time being, but notes there will be more information about this GIF maker arriving in a few weeks’ time.

            "194 Facebook’s new “Explore Feed” makes its way to the app’s main navigation\n",
            "Earlier this year, Facebook was spotted testing a new type of News Feed – one that designed to help you discover content across the social network, beyond posts from friends and Pages you already follow. During tests, the feed was available through the Facebook  app underneath a “rocket ship” icon – something that seemed to confuse users, who didn’t understand the feed’s purpose. Now this alternative feed is showing up for users under Facebook’s “More” menu, where it’s simply named “Explore Feed.” (One earlier test on iOS had labeled the feed “Explore” back in the beginning of the year, and apparently that name has stuck.) The “More” menu is where Facebook today steadily rolls out its new features as the social network expands to be more of an online portal, connecting you to resources within its own walls so that you won’t turn to Google, the web, or other mobile apps. For example, this menu is now home to things like Weather, Jobs, Games, Sports, Fundraisers, a “Find Wi-Fi” utility, and more. It’s also where Facebook launched its government-focused Town Hall feature, as well as its new Uber Eats and Seamless competitor, Order Food (which Papa John’s just joined this week, we should note.) The Explore Feed’s presence in this section hints at Facebook’s plans for a broader rollout, rather than a small experiment. But Facebook says it’s still considered a test, despite this prominent placement in Facebook’s main navigation. “We are testing a complementary feed of popular articles, videos, and photos, customized for each person based on content that might be interesting to them,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’ve heard from people that they want an easy way to explore new content they haven’t connected with yet.”  With Explore Feed, the goal is to connect users to Facebook’s broader network of news and information. The feed itself consists of posts, articles, photos and videos from sources you haven’t yet followed – like Facebook Pages or posts from news organizations. However, it’s not just a random selection. Facebook's Explore Feed on iOS. #fb pic.twitter.com/AyD9FVK4yC — Jose Gutierrez (@fbjag) July 14, 2017  There's a new \"Explore Feed\" option in @Facebook app that let's you see top posts from facebook trimmed for you. — Saurabh Charde (@SaurabhCharde) July 14, 2017  The Explore Feed consists of content from Facebook Pages that are similar to those you’ve already liked, as well as those popular with friends – like a video that a number of people in your network are watching, for instance. Facebook has for some time been working on a way to better leverage its deep understanding of a user’s likes and interests in different ways, largely to help increase users’ time on site, and therefore, Facebook’s bottom line. Even as far back as 2010, the network was experimenting with ways to help members curate their interests in order to find Pages they would like. In 2014, it tried a standalone app called Rooms that aimed to help people connect over shared interests, even if they weren’t friends. (The app was later shut down).  But Facebook users still gravitate towards their News Feed for discovery purposes. With Explore Feed’s shift to the “More” menu, there’s also now an introduction to the feed for first-time users, which should help clear up some of the earlier confusion. After tapping on the menu option, you’re directed to a separate page where a big illustration – with a rocket – that explains, “Welcome to Explore Feed,” along with the subheading: “Top posts for you, from across Facebook.” In my own tests, I found Explore Feed to be a fairly reliable source of new content to check out, though it doesn’t consist entirely of posts I’d consider “informative.” (But do I hate that the first thing I saw was a puppy video? Nope, not really.) Beyond that, Facebook surfaced content that matched up with my political views, as well as my interests in tech, parenting, media and entertainment. The Explore Feed is appearing on Facebook’s mobile app, but is not yet showing on desktop as far as we can tell. Not everyone will have the feed in their app at this time, but you should definitely check.  \n",

            "In an effort to seemingly combine a couple of the top tech trends of the year, Facebook  will soon be allowing users of its Oculus Rift virtual reality system to live stream themselves inside VR to their Facebook friends and followers as avatars. The Facebook Live functionality will be arriving on the Spaces app, which is still in beta. Users will be able to go live to all their friends and can position a virtual camera to capture their experience. A lot of things will look familiar to a traditional Live broadcast for the streamer, but things like physically reaching out and grabbing a comment to show those watching are things only possible in VR. Facebook Spaces may be just a preview of CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s 10-year vision for virtual reality at the company, but with Messenger video calls and Facebook Live broadcasts already coming to the app, it’s clear that the company isn’t shying away from building a bridge between its loftier VR bets and its central 2D service, which now boasts 2 billion users.  It may be a while before every feature sees a VR counterpart though. “There are things that aren’t going to map one-to-one, but I think in a lot of ways Facebook is sort of the 2D metaverse,” Facebook VR guru Mike Booth told TechCrunch. “It’s a huge network of people, places and things, so it’s a question of how we present those things in VR and how we let people access them and interact with them, but it’s also huge so there’re a lot of things to figure out and explore.” To Booth, bringing Facebook Live to Spaces is just as much about “evangelism” as anything else, allowing larger groups of friends to get exposed to the app and virtual reality in general. Whether users see the need to return to a feature like this is the real question; VR systems have some pretty obtrusive setups and don’t lend themselves to the ease of use that going Live on mobile boasts. Whether seeing avatars is fun and quirky or just gimmicky seems to be something that might be up for debate after only a couple minutes of live streaming, but for Facebook, much of their VR strategy involves a lot of trial and a lot of potential for error.  \n",

            "196 Facebook’s Messenger ads are bad and must be destroyed\n",
            "When Facebook  removed messages from the main app, I swore then and there that I would never download Messenger . That’s been a pretty easy promise to keep, especially since they introduced the lovely idea of enormous ads that take up half your screen while you try to use the service. Today Facebook redesigned them as part of a larger rollout — but fixed none of the reasons these ads are bad and should be destroyed. The ads may be “dynamic” as FB told me, but damn, look at the size of the things. They’re simply too large for the interface they’re invading, the image larger than any other element of the design. Even in the official video and images posted, the sponsored section takes up like two-thirds of the screen, and you better believe that’s the best-case scenario. Why so big? Did the ad department say they couldn’t sell anything that didn’t completely take over the app? Did they not want to ask for smaller assets after asking for ones at this size to begin with? Do they think people like ads as much as ad people do? At least now there’s only one ad instead of a series you’re invited to explore. I’m guessing engagement with the carousel was abysmal — who would think, hmm, not enough ads in my chat feed? To be fair, even good ads interrupt the user’s experience a little. But this is just way too much. As soon as you open the app, smack dab in the middle of the most-used main interface: an ad that takes up more of the screen than the content you opened the app to access. That’s intolerable.  I asked Facebook what its test users had said about the ads. A representative told me that “We monitored people’s engagement closely throughout the initial test and the results were promising…” and that “since we began testing in Australia and Thailand we have put people’s experience first, and we will continue to prioritize this as we roll out the Messenger ads test further.” The idea that these ads resulted from putting people’s experience first is, of course, ridiculous. If Facebook were doing that, it would never have snipped Messenger off from the main app in the first place, much less burdened it with huge ads. When I asked again what the users’ feedback had actually been, I received no response. I also asked if users could expect to see ads just one time, or every few threads, or what — but no info on that either. We’ll find out soon, but I’m guessing they’re keeping their options open on that one. Is it possible to make ads that fit on a mobile screen alongside your messaging content? Sure! In fact, I would bet that Facebook looked at several designs that did just that and rejected them. When you visit a retailer online, you get a popup that says sign up for our email list and you get 10 percent off your first purchase. I’m okay with that. When I search on Google for “air mattress” I see sponsored results for items at Walmart before the rest. I’m okay with that too. When I read an article at Anandtech, I see ads for things like power supplies (well, also the Cooking Channel). Sure! Hmm, maybe I could use a new NUC… All these ads are fine, relatively speaking, because they have context. They’re actually related to what I’m looking for or interested in, and no creepy tracking required! (Though it’s probably happening anyway.) Messenger’s ads have no context. They’re big banner ads that show up regardless of what you opened the app to do — and anyway, what advertisement could possibly make sense for the “asking a friend what they’re up to” use case? There isn’t one! The ads use the same targeting as other Facebook ads — no snooping in your messaging content yet. So if you’ve liked a bunch of retailer pages, you’ll probably see those, along with stuff in the same categories. That’s something, I guess, but who’s going to suddenly decide to browse men’s shoes at Timberland instead of responding to a message, which they opened the app to do? Messenger isn’t really a “free time” experience the way Facebook proper is — you use the former with purpose, the latter idly. Advertisements must cater to that, just like anywhere else in the world: you don’t see the same ads on subway walls (where you have to sit and stare) as on billboards (where you have two or three seconds max and your attention is elsewhere). Facebook survives on advertising revenue, but it is also responsive to stuff that isn’t working. These ads are in testing, though public announcements like this usually mean they’re pretty far along — not some random lark the company may or may not follow through on. I mean, ads are a guarantee at this point, and you can’t escape:  But if you don’t want enormous, intrusive ads prominently featured in your Messenger app, don’t touch them. Use the little dot menu at the upper right to hide ads. And don’t encourage them by selecting “This ad is useful.” Who does that?! Advertising is how things get paid for on the internet, including TechCrunch, so I’m not an advocate of eliminating it or blocking it altogether. But bad advertising experiences can spoil a perfectly good app like (for the purposes of argument) Messenger. Messaging is a personal, purposeful use case and these ads are a bad way to monetize it.  \n",

            "197 Facebook Messenger globally tests injecting display ads into inbox\n",
            "Messaging is the center of mobile, and Facebook  wants ads in front of all those eyes. After seeing “promising results from Australia and Thailand,” Facebook Messenger is expanding its display ad beta test that lets businesses buy space between your chat threads. Later this month, a small percentage of users will start seeing ads in the Messenger app’s home tab. Facebook tells TechCrunch that where these ads appear in the inbox “depends on how many threads a user has, the size of their phone’s physical screen and the pixel density of the display.” Over the next month, Facebook will gradually roll out Messenger ads to all advertisers globally. They’ll have the ability to buy through the Ads Manager or Power Editor, with Messenger becoming one of the automatic placements for Facebook ads alongside the main Facebook app, Instagram and the Audience Network of other apps and sites. Ads aren’t targeted by what people write in messages, and instead use the same Facebook targeting, measurement tools and minimum 50 percent pixels in view standard for viewability.  Facebook began testing the Messenger display ads in January, though the design has evolved from horizontally scrolling carousel design to single display ad design. This makes sense since Messenger’s recent redesign gave people tabs they could swipe through, which could have been accidentally triggered by people swiping through the ads. The display ads are the most traditional way that Facebook is trying to monetize its 1.2 billion user Messenger app. As Facebook runs out of ad inventory in its News Feed, which it’s warned could slow the company’s revenue growth, it’s seeking to put ads on more of its properties. Back in April 2016, Facebook started testing Sponsored Messages from brands you’ve already talked to before rolling them out to all developers. And Click To Message ads that send people from Facebook’s News Feed into a conversation with a brand started appearing in 2015.  The new Messenger display ads can lead to a website that’s rendered in the app’s internal browser. Alternatively, they can work like Click To Message ads, initiating a message thread with a company so they can convince you to buy something. Then, because you’ve already begun chatting with them, they’re eligible to send you Sponsored Messages in the future. “Expect Facebook to roll these out slowly, as they normally do, but integrate payments and M, which is what makes the Messenger platform special,” says Facebook ads expert and CTO of BlitzMetrics Dennis Yu. “This is where Facebook and Amazon compete to enable frictionless commerce, so hold onto your horses for a wild ride!” Yu is referring to the opportunity for Facebook to let you buy things straight through Messenger thanks to its in-app payment system used for peer-to-peer money transfers, and to use its M artificial intelligence assistant to make recommendations for when it recognizes that your texts signal that you might want to buy something.  For some, the Messenger ads will feel obtrusive, crammed in alongside your personal messages. There’s no way to permanently turn off Messenger ads, but you can tap the downward arrow in the bottom right of an ad to see options to report or hide it. But at least they aren’t masquerading as real content like the Sponsored Messages. If Facebook can avoid putting too many of these in the inbox, and only show them after a sufficient number of threads, they could help it monetize without significantly changing the feel of Messenger.  \n",

            "198 Facebook News Feed change demotes sketchy links overshared by spammers\n",
            "Technically, Facebook  can’t suspend people’s accounts just for sharing 50-plus false, sensational or clickbaity news articles per day. It doesn’t want to trample anyone’s right to share. But there’s nothing stopping it from burying those links low in the News Feed so few people ever see them. Today Facebook announced an algorithm change that does just that. It detects links that are aggressively shared by suspected spammers, and deprioritizes them in the News Feed. Facebook’s research shows that these links “tend to include low quality content such as clickbait, sensationalism, and misinformation,” so showing these links less prominently could improve the quality of what people see on the social network even if this change doesn’t analyze the specific content behind the links. If you just like to post a lot on Facebook, this shouldn’t affect you. Pages are free to post as much as they want as this change only scrutinizes individual user accounts. And Facebook says only Pages that depend on these spammers for traffic will see a drop in their distribution. That’s because Facebook’s VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri tells me it’s targeting “People who are sharing deliberately and purposefully . . . who purposely share vast quantities of things. Fifty-plus posts a day. Very significant statistical outliers. People having an outsize impact, inundating the News Feed with public content because they have some sort of agenda.” Example of clickbait shared on Facebook Facebook began its ongoing battle with clickbait back in 2014 by demoting links to websites people opened and immediately jumped back to Facebook. Since then it’s changed the algorithm to show fewer hoaxes, trained AI to weed out clickbait and spam, combatted fake news with reporting options and fact checkers, demoted links to crappy ad-filled sites and expanded its attack on clickbait to nine more languages. You can see all of Facebook’s dozens of algorithm changes in our Ultimate Guide To How Facebook News Feed Works. “We’re trying to do as much as we can to get false news, clickbait and sensationalism off our platform,” Mosseri insists. “We’re a platform that tries to empower people to share. And so these people are in a grey area. They’re spamming but not necessarily violating any specific policies that we have so we think this is the right type of approach.” If Facebook can banish this kind of content from its feed, people will spend more time reading, be more confident about what they click and Facebook can better fulfill its new mission statement to “bring the world closer together.” While blatantly false news gets most of the attention, it’s only a small fraction of what’s shared. Sensational and biased content that polarizes society is a more subtle but sizable problem. Downranking this content in News Feed could help liberals and conservatives build stronger bridges across the ideological divide.  \n",

            "199 Facebook is rolling out its ‘Find Wi-Fi’ feature worldwide\n",
            "Facebook  is expanding one of its newer features designed to help mobile users find accessible Wi-Fi networks. The company had begun testing a “Find Wi-Fi” option last year on mobile, which highlighted free, public Wi-Fi networks nearby. At the time, the option was only available on iOS in select countries, as something of a test. Today, Facebook announced users worldwide on both iOS and Android devices will soon gain access to “Find Wi-Fi.” The company explains the addition is useful for those times when you’re traveling, but especially so when you’re in an area where cellular data is “scarce,” it says. In developed markets like the U.S., that could mean more remote, rural locations, but in emerging markets, it’s an even more powerful tool as users often have limited data plans, and spotty cellular coverage in general. The feature, like other new additions to Facebook’s portal, is found under the “More” tab in the Facebook mobile app. Once you locate the “Find Wi-Fi” tab, Facebook notes you may need to turn it on. Afterwards, Facebook will display a map showing the closest hotspots, as well as details about the businesses that provide them.  Besides being a handy addition that helps Facebook’s now 2 billion monthly users stay connected to the network and spend more time in its app – something that directly impacts Facebook’s bottom line – the tool also serves as another way to discover local businesses. That means users might start turning to Facebook to find the closest coffee shop with Wi-Fi, instead of Google Maps. But the feature isn’t as of yet as reliable as it should be, we found – though it easily picked up Wi-Fi hotspots at nearby restaurants and malls, for example, it didn’t include the closest Starbucks or McDonald’s in our list of suggestions. (Your mileage may vary.) This is because, for the feature to work, a business must first claim their Wi-Fi network by navigating to their “Edit Page Info” on their Facebook Page. Or, more simply put, it’s an opt-in setting. That being said, the feature has seen good adoption during the tests starting last year. And now that businesses know it’s a globally available feature, that adoption may increase.  A tool for listing Wi-Fi networks is hardly Facebook’s only effort with regard to helping users with mobile connectivity. The company has much larger projects underway in this area, including efforts via its Internet.org arm to expand mobile connectivity in emerging markets, infrastructure investments around the world, plans to use solar-powered drones for delivering connectivity and more.

            "Facebook’s  plan to use large solar-powered high-altitude drones to connect areas of the world that traditionally haven’t had reliable internet access marked a significant milestone on Thursday. Aquila, its first functional aircraft, completed its second successful test flight — and landed successfully, too. The first time around, Aquila’s flight resulted in a structural failure that affected the craft’s landing and resulted in an NTSB investigation. Aquila’s second flight occurred on May 22, with take-off occurring just after dawn, and a total flight time of one hour and 46 minutes in the air. The drone rose to a flight ceiling of above 3,000 feet, and climbed at a rate that was double that of the first test flight — Aquila ascended at 180 feet/minute, which the team working on the project says was a result of a number of “refinements” made to the Aquila platform as a result of info gleaned from the first test. Facebook notes that by design, the Aquila craft doesn’t do anything terribly fast, despite the increases in climb rate; it only flies at about 10-15 mph when flying upwind, but it’s meant to provide consistent access to an area by staying over it for a relatively long time, so that’s actually advantageous. It can do this by sipping power generated by its solar gathering system — it runs on the same amount of power consumed by three blow dryers, Facebook says. This second voyage for Aquila was also all about gathering data, specifically to help the team adjust the models they use to predict energy usage and optimize battery and solar system design, based on real-world data. These have, of course, been extensively modeled in simulation, but actually flying a drone in conditions similar to how it would be deployed when active commercially is the only way to get those details right. Aquila also tested new spoilers it has incorporated into the design to help it increase drag and reduce speed, and it tested radio signal strength aboard the craft. Those added spoilers also help with landing, the process of which was revised based on the first flight’s issues. Facebook says that this new process, which included locking the propellers horizontally to reduce damage, worked mostly as designed — though only one propeller on the craft actually locked horizontally, while the rest remained vertical until landing, as you can see in the clip above. All four motors stopped as intended, however, and the craft landed softly on a gravel surface, resulting in “a few minor, easily repairable dings,” which is a much better result than they had the first time around. The team still intends to tweak this to help ensure it works better in the future. The plan eventually is for Aquila to fly for up to 90 days at a time, offering internet access to an area 60 miles wide using the giant craft, which has a massive 113-foot wingspan.  \n",

            "Facebook  says it’s introducing a number of new measurements for businesses that buy ads and own Facebook Pages. Last year, the company admitted that it had been misreporting some metrics — individually, none of the mistakes seemed particularly serious, but cumulatively, they created the impression that the company needs to work harder on transparency for advertisers. (It’s also opened up for an audit from the Media Rating Council.) Similarly, none of the new metrics that Facebook is announcing today may make that big a difference individually, but the company says they’re part of a broader initiative. “We’ve heard feedback from businesses that they want more transparency and understanding around their Facebook performance,” Facebook said in a blog post. “As part of our commitment to measurement, about every month or so we’ll release new metrics so that businesses have better ways to measure outcomes, all in one place.” The most interesting new metric is called “landing page views,” which tells advertisers how many users actually made it to their mobile landing page after clicking on an ad.  According to Facebook, this measurement should “help businesses realize the importance of optimizing for a better mobile web experience.” This has been a recurring theme at Facebook, which has been trying to circumvent slow web experiences by bringing more of that content into Facebook itself through formats like Instant Articles (for news publishers) and Canvas (for advertisers). Other new metrics include a breakdown of whether or not people who click on an ad had previously interacted with the advertiser’s website or app. And there are new measurements for Facebook Pages — the growth or decline of followers, the number of people who encounter Page information (without clicking on the Page itself) through previews and the number of times a Page has been included as part of someone’s recommendations.  \n",

            "Facebook  isn’t done with chatbots quite yet; today, the company is launching Discover, a hub inside Messenger for discovering new and interesting chatbots to message with.  The section Facebook announced at F8 is going live for users stateside, and the company is billing it as an opportunity for people to interact with businesses and brands in more useful ways. The platform is, you guessed it, all about discovering new bots to give a whirl. In the tab, you’ll be able to browse through categories of bots, see featured bots and check out the ones you’ve recently used. Discover will make it easier to find bots sure, but the feature seems to be more about re-emphasizing the chatbots medium. Messenger has been known to be fast-and-dirty in trying new features, even more so than the core Facebook app, and for about a two-week period last year, they were heavily selling the idea of bots. The underlying tenets of chatbots are incredibly interesting, but they’ve just been so stupid that there hasn’t seemed to be a ton of use for them. As the features move inside message threads with friends themselves, Facebook hopes that users will treat them more as utilities rather than voice assistant-style robots they can talk at. Facebook has already begun adding chatbot-esque features into the DNA of Messenger through its “M” AI assistant, but the company wants to build out the platform to enable automated interactions between users and businesses as it looks to make Pages the more default online homes of brands and Messenger the way you communicate with them. With the Discover platform launching, there’s surely going to be a lot more attention on chatbots; we’ll see whether developers give the platform another whirl or if the trend dies out.  \n",

            "LiveLike, the service that partners with sports broadcasters to create and host their VR viewing experiences, is going social. As a refresher, LiveLike’s VR experience is a “virtual suite” overlooking the field, where you can select different camera angles, look around the suite, view pre-produced content, etc. We’ve looked at the experience before, and think it’s much more interactive than VR solutions that just provide viewers with a floating screen to watch the game. And now you’ll be able to do this with friends. Starting with the CONCACAF Soccer Gold Cup next week, users in the Fox Sports VR App (made by LiveLike) will be able to watch with their friends. Upon opening the app, users will be able to connect to Facebook and join a room with any of their Facebook friends who have also downloaded the app, or can select a random option where they are put in a room with three other viewers.  In the app you appear as an avatar (which is basic, but still slightly customizable) with your name above, and can turn and talk to your friends while watching the game. LiveLike explained that they’re using 3D audio, meaning your friend’s voice will get louder when you look at them and quieter when you turn back to the action, making the experience feel a little more real. And to make it more accessible for everyone, you now don’t even need to have a headset to use the app. Users can still download the app on their phone or tablet and experience a slimmed-down version — basically they can scroll and pan around and see everything they’d see if they were actually in VR. LiveLike is planning to put this social feature in every deployment they do going forward, but cautioned that there is a chance some partners may not want the feature in their broadcast. But outside of that, LiveLike sees these social features as the future of their platform. Eventually the startup wants to build in community-focused functionality, like the ability to watch the game in a virtual room with other fans from your team. And this community aspect could convince fans to increase the time they spend in VR, which may help transform it from a novelty into an experience people actually prefer over traditional TV, especially if they are watching alone. Here’s a video of what LiveLike’s experience looks like now (without the new social features).   \n",

            "“We’re getting to a size where it’s worth really taking a careful look at what are all the things that we can do to make social media the most positive force for good possible,” Facebook  Chief Product Officer Chris Cox told TechCrunch about the company’s new milestone. Thirteen years after launching and less than five years after hitting 1 billion, Facebook now has 2 billion monthly active users. Facebook wants people to celebrate with a personalized “Good Adds Up” video they can make and share here. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg played it cool with this brief announcement message. Two billion makes Facebook the largest social app in terms of logged-in users, above YouTube’s 1.5 billion, WeChat’s 889 million, Twitter’s 328 million and Snapchat’s estimated 255 million (extrapolated from its December 2015 ratio when it had 110 million daily and 170 million monthly users). Beyond YouTube, only Facebook’s other apps have more than 1 billion, including WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, with 1.2 billion each. Instagram might soon join that club as it recently rocketed past 700 million. Facebook’s growth the last half decade has been fueled by the developing world. The company has relentlessly optimized its app for cheap Android smartphones and low-bandwidth connections. It’s added 746 million users in Asia and the Rest of World region since hitting 1 billion users total. Meanwhile, it only added 41 million in the U.S. and Canada.  Despite Facebook’s size and age, at 17 percent its user count is growing as fast or faster than any year since 2012. And people aren’t using it less either. In fact, 66 percent of Facebook’s monthly users return each day now compared to 55 percent when it hit 1 billion. If the teenaged social network isn’t as cool to teenagers any more, it’s not showing in the big metrics. But neither does the colossal impact Facebook has had on society, which it’s now trying to bend toward positivity with its new mission statement to “Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” “There’s definitely a deep sense of responsibility in every part of the company,” Cox told TechCrunch. “We’re getting to the scale where we have to get much better about understanding how the product has been used.” That’s why he’s been traveling around the world doing user research. And it’s why Mark Zuckerberg has been crisscrossing the country on a listening tour that many people cynically assume is the start to a run for president, despite the CEO’s denials. Perhaps stewarding a 2-billion-person community is responsibility enough to get out of Silicon Valley and figure out how Facebook impacts people’s lives. 1/Zuck isn't running for President. He's trying to understand the role the product he created played in getting this one elected. — Nathan Hubbard (@NathanCHubbard) June 25, 2017  There are the big, newsy things like suicides on Facebook Live and fears that fake news got Donald Trump elected. But deeper down, there are even more complex ramifications of a near ubiquitous social network. It can propel internet addiction that alienates people, and facilitate the filter bubbles that polarize society by reinforcing our opinions. Facebook has largely conquered its competitors, giving it the slack to finally address the modern sociological challenges that stem from its popularity. Cox says an important pattern Facebook is adopting is “When you think about very complex systems that are affecting humanity, just being open about what’s happening. And then for example in the case of something like suicide or bullying, going and working with subject matter experts, getting the research on what’s the best possible thing that we can do, and then talking to the world about it.” To make the discussion about these tragic moments as accessible and productive as possible, Facebook has taken to publishing transparency reports and explainers about its policies and procedures. “I live with the constant goal of understanding, for every single thing that we do, how do we maximize all that goodness, and curtail any way that it can be misused or turned into something sad” Cox solemnly concludes. If getting to 1 billion was about building a product, and getting to 2 billion was about building a user base, Facebook’s responsibility is to build empathy between us as it reaches for 3 billion.  \n",

            "Facebook  M, the company’s AI-powered assistant that lives inside Messenger, was launched widely back in April, giving suggestions to users based on the context of their conversations. Today, M is getting a bit smarter and more socially capable.  Perhaps most notable is that the AI assistant will now proactively remind users to save pieces of content like articles, videos or FB posts to check out later or share in message threads using the “Saved” extension. If you’re someone who gets sent a lot of things to read from your friends, this should help you stay on top of it all so you don’t have to lie when they ask you what you thought of something they sent you in Messenger . It’s interesting that Messenger’s M is really being taught to help you avoid social faux pas, as well, things that really may save you in some situations. One incoming set of suggestions is related to birthdays, ensuring that if you’ve been chatting with someone, you’re reminded to wish them a happy birthday. Lastly, M will be adding suggestions for voice or video calls, so if you’re in a one-on-one or group conversation and someone says, “Can you call me?” M may pop up offering a quick tap to make the call inside Messenger. It will be interesting to see what summons this and whether Messenger can piggyback on the brand success of others so that when you ask a friend to FaceTime or Skype you, M suggests you use a Messenger video call. It’s still early days for M; Facebook has been driving pretty small features that offer minute improvements to conversations without overwhelming users or being overly obtrusive. As the features subtly build, M’s guidance may become more indispensable, or it may just become another new Messenger feature you turn off in the settings.  \n",

            "Today Facebook, Microsoft, YouTube  and Twitter  collectively announced a new partnership aimed at reducing the accessibility of internet services to terrorists. The new Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism adds structure to existing efforts by the companies to target and remove from major web platforms recruiting materials for terror groups. Together, the four tech leaders say they will collaborate on engineering solutions to the problem, sharing content classification techniques and effective reporting methods for users. Each company also will contribute to both technical and policy research and share best practices for counterspeech initiatives. Back in December of 2016, the same four companies announced the creation of a shared industry hash database. By sharing hashes with each other, the group was able to collectively identify terror accounts without each having to do the time- and resource-intensive legwork independently. This new organization creates more formal bureaucracy for improving that database. Similarly, Facebook, Microsoft, YouTube and Twitter will be teaching smaller companies and organizations to follow in their footsteps to adopt their own proactive plans for combating terror. A portion of this training will cover key strategies for executing counterspeech programs like YouTube’s Creators for Change and Facebook’s P2P and OCCI. All of these actions are occurring side-by-side with public sector efforts. The G7 has been vocal about the importance of combating extremism with a multi-pronged approach. Today’s partnership further solidifies the relationship between four multi-national tech companies with the aim of pushing back against terrorism on their respective platforms.  \n",

            "Facebook  is bringing a ton of new filters, masks and video reactions to video chats in Messenger, aiming to deliver a more fun experience to younger users on the app and shore up the service against competing video chat apps. The update is centered all around fun, visual filters.  Video reactions will allow you to choose one of the Facebook reaction emojis and bring up custom video filters that share your joy, anger, sadness or more. The live filters allow you to react to conversations in a more visual way. Additionally, the service is introducing stylistic filters that can give your video footage a different color hue or lighting type. You’ll be able to preview these filters live before sharing the style with your group. Continuing with the filter-centered update, Facebook is bringing some new augmented reality masks to video chats, allowing users a greater depth of variety in what exactly they can become onscreen. Animated effects like falling hearts and shooting stars that react to your movements will also be included in the update. Alongside the filter updates, Messenger will be making it easier for users to take screenshots of their video chat conversations with a dedicated button that will save images so you can easily preserve a snapshot of a call without fumbling with multi-button combinations. While services like FaceTime are popular, they’re pretty bare-bones compared to most photo and video apps out there. iMessages has already copied more fun-loving chat apps in a lot of ways, but video chat is still pretty dull. Adding in some fun and goofy filters gives Messenger a chance at capturing the attention of more young users, though the app continuing to add complexity also risks creating headaches for those who just want an easy way to chat with their FB friends.  \n",

            "208 Facebook expands its hate-fighting counterspeech initiative in Europe\n",
            "Facebook  has launched a third counterspeech initiative in Europe, partnering with the not-for-profit Institute for Strategic Dialogue for the launch of the Online Civil Courage Initiative (OCCI), which is aimed at tackling online extremism and hate speech. COO Sheryl Sandberg launched the initiative in London this morning along with Sasha Havlicek, CEO of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, and with the UK founding partners for the initiative who are: The OCCI will commit financial and marketing support to UK NGOs working to counter online extremism, including the four listed above. Facebook said the aim is to bring together experts to develop best practice and tools for people to engage in counter speech. The move follows similar initiatives launched by the company in Germany in January 2016 and in France in March 2017. At the initial launch in Germany Facebook pledged more than €1 million in funding for NGOs under the OCCI program. It’s not clear if Facebook has since expanded its funding commitment for the program — we’ve asked and will update this post with any response. In the UK the OCCI will provide: Overall, the initiative aims to enable a community of local organisations and activists to “share campaigns, experiences, advice and challenges” — using Facebook’s own Groups feature as their networking media. To date, Facebook says OCCI across Europe has engaged in direct training at OCCI Counterspeech Labs and workshops with more than 100 anti-hate and anti-extremism organisations, reaching some 3.5 million people online via — you guessed it — its Facebook page. The company has previously talked about how counterspeech training is a part of its strategy to tackle online extremism, noting this in its first Hard Questions post — which focused on what it’s doing to counter terrorism. Hard Questions is a series of policy discussions the company announced and initiated last week, soliciting feedback from users on a variety of questions and concerns — from countering the spread of extremist content to considering whether social media is generally good for democracy? And given Facebook’s staggering size — with the platform now having amassed nearly two billion users globally — the company has clearly reached a tipping point in terms of realizing it must at very least be seen to be acknowledging it has a responsibility to consider the wider impacts of its platform. The days of Zuckerberg just being able to shrug his shoulders at concerns by claiming Facebook is just a technology platform are well and truly behind it. Yet it remains to be seen what practical measures and changes to how Facebook does business will flow from this series of grown up public discussions. And cynical voices might say Facebook is seeking to turn criticism of its platform into increased engagement on its platform. The company has certainly been facing increased attacks in recent times, including from politicians seeking to scapegoat tech platforms for not doing enough to counter extremism. And — more broadly — for not taking their social responsibilities seriously enough. A UK parliamentary committee recently slammed tech giants including Facebook for taking a laissez-faire attitude to content moderation, for example — and suggested the government should look at implementing fines for failures on this front. Something it has said it is considering. Meanwhile, in Germany, a legislative proposal that includes fines of up to €50M for social media firms failing to promptly remove illegal hate speech after a complaint has gained government backing. Perhaps we therefore should not be surprised that Facebook revealed a new mission statement yesterday — saying it now wants to: “Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” It’s certainly a slogan that better aligns with current political priorities in a world that’s sounding increasingly divided and divisive. And one that Facebook will surely be hoping not merely takes the heat away from its platform, but — via the likes of this expanded counterspeech initiative — works to rechannel the negative energy being directed at its platform and turn it into increase engagement on its platform.  \n",

            "Facebook’s  Oculus  is returning to San Jose on October 11-12 this year to share some news about the future of VR at the company’s Oculus Connect 4 developers conference. This past year’s conference was very much focused on showing off the content being made for Oculus’ GearVR and Rift platforms. It was also notable because Facebook’s presence was more heavily emphasized as Zuckerberg delivered much of the keynote, sharing new product news. IT'S HAPPENING! pic.twitter.com/F7Tt7RJdeY — Reverend Kyle (@reverendkjr) June 22, 2017  Over the past year, Facebook has slowly been bringing the Oculus name and leadership under its own core brand. With the amount of VR news popping up at F8, some wondered whether Oculus Connect’s days were numbered, but ultimately it seems Facebook continues to believe the gaming focus of the conference needs its own stage. This will be the conference under Facebook VP of VR Hugo Barra, who took over the reigns a few months ago after CEO and co-founder Brendan Iribe suddenly stepped down in December. This also will be the first conference since co-founder Palmer Luckey left the company, though he was absent from the convention center last year, as well. Discussion of new gaming exclusives is often a topic at Oculus Connect. This year will be interesting, especially as Oculus was left out of the loop at E3 as a number of VR titles emerged from games publisher Bethesda, including Skyrim, Fallout 4 and Doom, that will not be coming to the Rift due to the ongoing legal troubles between its parent company, ZeniMax Media, and Oculus. This year we can probably expect to see a new version of the all-in-one “Santa Cruz” headset prototype, which is hopefully getting closer to becoming a reality. It’s early, so no details on OC4 registration or the talks that will be given, but we’ll keep you updated.  \n",

            "Facebook sees Groups as the core of its push to “build community,” as Mark Zuckerberg detailed in his 6,000-word humanitarian manifesto. So today at its Communities Summit in Chicago, where it assembled 300 admins of top Groups, Facebook is making good on Zuckerberg’s promise to give admins more tools to manage their flocks. These include Group analytics, membership request filtering, removed member clean-up, scheduled posts and group-to-group linking. These tools automate or facilitate the busy work that Group admins were already slogging through manually to assist their constituencies. Their rollout should increase the sharing of resonant content as well as the sense of tight-knit camaraderie and vulnerability in groups — ranging from activist leagues to patient support networks to hobbyist clubs. “Groups have been around since the very beginning of Facebook,” Chief Product Officer Chris Cox tells me. “The original Facebook was more of a communities product than it was about friends. ‘Who else was in my dorm? Who else was in my school? Who else was in my club?’ It wasn’t sharing photos of with my friends, which is what Facebook became.” Cox says that almost wistfully, as if he’s internalized Facebook’s slide from deepening real-world bonds toward digital voyeurism. But Facebook’s on a new mission to reclaim that original purpose. In fact, today Facebook unveiled its new mission statement: “Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” This evolution from “making the world more open and connected” acknowledges that more raw connection isn’t always good — it must be in the service of strengthening our bridges to the people and world around us. And to turn the mission into a goal, Zuckerberg says Facebook wants to help 1 billion people join meaningful communities. But first, Facebook needs to equip admins to make their Groups more meaningful. In his community letter Zuckerberg wrote that Facebook needed to “build more tools to empower community leaders … to run and grow their groups the way they’d like.” Here they are: Group Insights: Analytics have been Facebook’s top request from Group admins, so it’s hooking them up with a similar Insights product to what Page admins have on both web and mobile. This includes real-time growth, membership and engagement metrics, including how many posts are being published and when their content is most popular. Understanding what content resonates could help admins share more like it.  Scheduled Posts: Along with analytics to know the best time to post, Facebook is allowing admins and moderators to schedule posts at those times, or to compose content whenever’s convenient for them and post it later. This permits busy Group admins to write a bunch of posts over the weekend, and then schedule them to publish throughout the week, which is especially important as all these admins are essentially volunteers with day jobs.  Group To Group Linking: Some Groups are local chapters of bigger organizations, or are connected to similar groups with overlapping memberships. Group to group linking lets admins display suggestions of similar or related groups that their members might want to join, too. Facebook says more formal sub-Group structuring is coming. Together, these could improve Group discovery while encouraging local- or interest-based branches of Groups to assemble and have more intimate conversations.  Removed Member Cleanup: If a troll or troublemaker slips into a Group and gets removed, Facebook now allows admins to instantly delete all their posts and comments, and rescind recent invites they’ve sent to potential new members. Facebook could disincentivize Group trolling by making it easy to purge them from the record.  Membership Request Filtering: Facebook already launched the ability to gate Group membership with a screening questionnaire to make sure the potential admit isn’t a troll or will dilute the community. Now Facebook is automating the screening decision process by letting admins set filters to only admit certain genders or people from specific locations. Unfortunately, these inflexible rules could potentially exclude people they shouldn’t.  For example, these filters could bar someone who is biologically a man but identifies as a women and wants to join a women’s group, or someone who lives in San Francisco but wants to join an Oakland  community group because they frequently stay with and take care of their sick mom who lives there. Though it takes tons of time and can be a boring chore, human admins who filter through membership requests know when to let someone slide. I asked Facebook if there was an appeals process for people who believe they’ve been wrongfully rejected from a Group. While the company says there isn’t, it plans to look closely at the problem of overly strict filters. Facebook has a tough challenge ahead trying to design one-size-fits-all products for the 1 billion-plus people who use Facebook every month. But there’s also a massive opportunity. While there are more and more social apps where you can watch your friends, and news apps where you can follow the world, Groups is a relatively unique product to Facebook. If it can make Groups better, and thereby convince more people to join more great ones, Facebook could give people a whole new stream of more niche, personal content outside the News Feed.  \n",

            "Facebook  is introducing a new feature to give users peace of mind around how their profile photo can be used and accessed by others. The social network today announced a pilot program in India that is designed to protect users who are concerned about other people gaining access to their profile image. The new ‘photo guard’ feature has a range of safety measures that include: When activated, the optional guard is visible through a blue border and shield around a user’s profile pic. The company partnered with an Indian illustrator to make these safety controls more compelling with attractively designed options.   Posted by Facebook Safety on Tuesday, June 20, 2017 The new feature is driven by research that the company undertook in India. In a blog post, Facebook explained that it found that “some women choose not to share profile pictures that include their faces anywhere on the internet because they’re concerned about what may happen to their photos.” It believes this solution may go some way to helping, and it said that early tests indicate that people are 75 percent less likely to copy a photo when the guard option is enabled. This rollout is initially happening in India, but Facebook said it hopes to expand it to other countries “soon.”  \n",

            "When Mercari became Japan’s first startup unicorn with a $75 million round last year, the funding was earmarked to fuel its goal of becoming the top secondhand marketplace app in the U.S. Now Mercari is doubling down on its efforts to succeed where no other Asian e-commerce company has. Today it launched a refreshed version of its American app and announced the hiring of John Lagerling from Facebook’s management team to serve as its chief business officer. Though Alibaba and Rakuten have struggled to make an impact in the U.S., Lagerling says that doesn’t scare Mercari . The app has been downloaded a total of 25 million times so far, compared to 10 million a year ago, and it currently claims $100 million in transactions per month worldwide. But Mercari has to fight for American shoppers with a host of secondhand marketplace apps (including OfferUp, Letgo, Poshmark, and Depop, to name just a few) and, of course, all of them are up against eBay and Amazon, which have had two decades to define the U.S. e-commerce landscape. Lagerling, who was vice president of business development, mobile, and product partnerships at Facebook and previously held several leadership roles at Google, tells TechCrunch that Mercari sees the U.S. as a top priority, instead of secondary to its domestic market. “If you are too mature in your home market as a company, investing resources elsewhere always becomes a second priority, and unless you can make it a top-level company priority to become successful in a new market as a challenger, it’s really hard to make it,” he says. Mercari views its U.S. business as a crucial stepping stone for success in other countries (it also launched in the U.K. recently). “If Mercari can make it in the U.S., I’m sure we can make it elsewhere, too. It forces companies to go up to global standards quickly and I think the U.S. is one of the most competitive markets globally. That will basically build muscle to be competitive elsewhere,” Lagerling says. “It’s a bold move, but I think it will pay off.” In San Francisco, Lagerling will be in charge of a fast-growing team. Mercari is in the midst of a hiring spree, with 100 employees in the U.S. now, compared to just 30 people a year ago (it has 400 people in Japan).  In addition to a new look, Mercari’s U.S. app now has a specific codebase, which means new functions will reach American users more quickly. Japanese apps tend to look very cluttered to Americans, so the U.S. app is visually cleaner, and it also makes it easier for people to search for what they want in different categories (Lagerling says Japanese users tend to make purchases by browsing through recommended items). Mercari will also boost its marketing spending, buying ads in traditional media and other places to increase its brand profile. The company wants to differentiate from its rivals by creating a user experience that is so easy it becomes the default secondhand marketplace app. This means not only making it seamless for sellers to upload items, but also ship them to buyers. In Japan, Mercari also had to battle established e-commerce companies, like Yahoo! Japan and Rakuten, after it launched in 2013. It gained popularity by making logistics pain-free and it wants to replicate that experience for U.S. users. In its domestic market, Mercari integrates with Yamato Transport, one of the Japan’s largest couriers, while in the U.S. it is already working with USPS and FedEx to provide services like automatically calculated shipping labels (it will even print and mail them to sellers who don’t own a printer). Mercari plans to add more shipping companies and work with startups that want to solve technical challenges related to logistics. “I think there is room for innovation in the U.S. and traditional players, like eBay, haven’t really gone to innovate there,” says Lagerling. Logistics is harder to manage in the U.S. than Japan, however, and Mercari also has to fight to keep the interest of users who have an increasingly wide array of options for selling their stuff. But Lagerling says the number of people willing to sell goods on Facebook and Instagram, even though those transactions often involve a lot of messaging and in-person pickups, proves that there is still a need that its rivals haven’t met—and room for Mercari to succeed where other Asian e-commerce companies haven’t. Lagerling conducted his master’s thesis research at the University of Tokyo’s Graduate School of Economics and spent several years working in Japan, first at telecom NTT DoCoMo and then Google. Lagerling says Mercari’s culture is similar to American companies, which he thinks gives it an advantage. “A lot of the best practices from Google, Facebook, and other companies have already been adopted by Mercari, which was refreshing to see. Silicon Valley companies are surprisingly consensus driven, which is not true for all corporate cultures, and Mercari is similar to them,” he says. “Frankly, that’s one of the reasons why it will be one of the few Japanese companies to be successful abroad.”  \n",

            "A lot of chatbots have launched on Facebook in recent months, but the Ticketmaster bot launching today is among the best that I’ve been forced to work with. Normally I avoid reaching out to businesses through Facebook (it still doesn’t seem like a natural channel to me — and I’m old), but there’s real utility in Ticketmaster’s  bot if you’re willing to give up a certain amount of privacy. The bot’s natural language processing works well and not as programmatically as some others I’ve had to deal with. Instead of walking someone through a transaction using prompts that feel unnatural, the bot can recognize prompts like “What’s happening tonight?” and come up with responses. The bot will literally show you every event that Ticketmaster is serving up in an area (in a place like LA, that can be a little overwhelming). It’ll also respond to requests about the schedule for specific artists… so if there’s a band you want to see and don’t know whether they’ll be coming to your area, the message bot can tell you (so long as they’re playing at a Ticketmaster venue). Search data covers 83 countries, so the bot has you covered even if you’re on the road. The company says the information is shareable, too, so if (unlike me) you have friends who care about you, you can gather a gaggle to take in a show. The one issue I had with the bot was the lack of in-chat purchasing. You still need to click a link that takes you into Ticketmaster to make a purchase. It’d be better if the buying option were seamless, but I was told by Ticketmaster developers that the in-chat buying option is something they’re working on. As the convergence of online and offline commerce continues to dominate the thinking among physical stores, and as experiential marketing and events become more of a thing, expect to see Ticketmaster continue to expand its digital footprint. I’ve been in LA at Ticketmaster’s Summit and there’re definitely some more interesting things coming down the road from them. Here are some screenshots to give you a sense of the experience:  \n",

            "At Facebook,  the IT organization isn’t called “IT.” Instead, it’s referred to as the “enterprise engineering organization.” As Facebook client platform engineer Nick McSpadden told me, that’s because at a company that operates at the scale of Facebook, IT has to be about more than pushing buttons on a vendor product. And to emphasize this, the company today open sourced one of its internal IT management services for giving users access to products in Adobe’s Creative Cloud. The enterprise engineering organization at Facebook currently manages almost 30,000 computers and close to 40,000 mobile devices. Most of the laptops and desktops run OS X, but there are also about 8,000 Windows machines involved. “After you get to a certain size, there aren’t a lot of turnkey solutions you can buy from vendors,” McSpadden notes. So the team uses a lot of open source tools and builds its own when necessary. McSpadden argues that vendors tend to build their solutions for mainstream use cases, but there are always edge cases, and, at the scale of a company like Facebook, those edge cases can quickly add up and drain the IT team’s productivity. The team decided on open sourcing these Adobe-centric tools because it’s such a widely used vendor and because it has such a wide audience. Facebook’s scripts allow enterprise organizations to easily add new accounts to their Adobe subscription (which at this scale is likely based on an enterprise agreement), give specific users access to certain tools and remove that access again when necessary. McSpadden tells me that Adobe itself is excited about seeing this new tool going open source and he stressed that there is really nothing Facebook-specific about the code. “We don’t want to release things that only work at FB,” he said. “We want it to be possible for anybody to be able to work with this out of the box.” The code is now available on GitHub, and McSpadden tells me that Facebook would be happy to take outside contributions.  \n",

            "How should Facebook decide what’s allowed on its social network, and how to balance safety and truth with diverse opinions and cultural norms? Facebook wants your feedback on the toughest issues it’s grappling with, so today it published a list of seven “hard questions” and an email address — hardquestions@fb.com — where you can send feedback and suggestions for more questions it should address. Facebook’s plan is to publish blog posts examining its logic around each of these questions, starting later today with one about responding to the spread of terrorism online, and how Facebook is attacking the problem. [Update: Here is Facebook’s first entry in its “Hard Questions” series, which looks at how it counters terrorism. We have more analysis on it below] “Even when you’re skeptical of our choices, we hope these posts give a better sense of how we approach them — and how seriously we take them” Facebook’s VP of public policy Elliot Schrage writes. “And we believe that by becoming more open and accountable, we should be able to make fewer mistakes, and correct them faster.”  Here’s the list of hard questions with some context from TechCrunch about each: Facebook has worked in the past to shut down Pages and accounts that blatantly spread terrorist rhetoric. But the tougher decisions come in the grey area fringe, and where to draw the line between outspoken discourse and propaganda Facebook currently makes people’s accounts into memorial pages that can be moderated by a loved one that they designate as their “legacy contact” before they pass away, but it’s messy to give that control to someone, even a family member, if the deceased didn’t make the choice. Facebook has to walk a thin line between making its app safe for a wide range of ages as well as advertisers, and avoiding censorship of hotly debated topics. Facebook has recently gotten into hot water over temporarily taking down videos of the aftermath of police violence, and child nudity in a newsworthy historical photo pointing out the horrors of war. Mark Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to allow people to be able to set the severity of its filter, and use the average regional setting from their community as the default, but that still involves making a lot of tough calls when local norms conflict with global ones.  Facebook has been racked with criticism since the 2016 US presidential election over claims that it didn’t do enough to prevent the spread of fake news, including right-wing conspiracy theories and exaggerations that may have given Donald Trump an advantage. If Facebook becomes the truth police and makes polarizing decisions, it could alienate the conservative side of its user base and further fracture online communities, but if it stands idle, it may grossly interfere with the need for an informed electorate. On a similar front, Facebook is dealing with how peer-to-peer distribution of “news” omits the professional editors who typically protect readers from inaccuracy and misinformation. That problem is exacerbated when sensationalist or deceitful content is often the most engaging, and that’s what the News Feed that highlights. Facebook has changed its algorithm to downrank fake news and works with outside fact checkers, but more subtle filter bubbles threaten to isolate us from opposing perspectives. Facebook is a data mining machine, for better or worse. This data powers helpful personalization of content, but also enables highly targeted advertising, and gives Facebook massive influence over a wide range of industries as well as our privacy. What’s important news or lighthearted entertainment for adults can be shocking or disturbing for kids. Meanwhile, Facebook must balance giving younger users the ability to connect with each other and form support networks with keeping them safe from predators. Facebook has restricted the ability of adults to search for kids and offers many resources for parents, but does allow minors to post publicly which could expose them to interactions with strangers. Facebook’s post about how it deals with terrorism is much less of a conversation starter, and instead mainly lists ways its combatting their propaganda with AI, human staff, and partnerships. Image via BuzzNigeriaFacebook’s methods for combatting terrorism on its social network include: Image via BuzzNigeria Unfortunately, the post doesn’t even include the feedback email address, nor does it pose any philosophical questions about where to draw the line when reviewing propaganda. [Update: After I pointed out the hardquestions@fb.com was missing from the counter-terrorism post, Facebook added it and tells me it will be included on all future Hard Questions posts. That’s a good sign that it’s already willing to listen and act on feedback.] The subtext behind the hard questions is that Facebook has to figure out how to exist as “not a traditional media company” as Zuckerberg referred to it. The social network is simultaneously an open technology platform that’s just a skeleton fleshed out by what users volunteer, but also an editorialized publisher that makes value judgements about what’s informative or entertaining, and what’s misleading or distracting. It’s wise of Facebook to pose these questions publicly rather than letting them fester in the dark. Perhaps the transparency will give people the peace of mind that Facebook is at least thinking hard about these issues. The question is whether this transparency gives Facebook leeway to act cautiously when the problems are urgent yet it’s earning billions in profit per quarter. It’s not enough just to crowdsource feedback and solutions. Facebook must enact them even if they hamper its business.  \n",

            "Reply threads on Facebook  are about to get a lot more animated. To mark the 30th anniversary of the GIF format, all users will get the new GIF comment button that Facebook began testing three months ago. Facebook also announced that almost 13 billion GIFs were sent on Messenger over the past year, with 400 million GIFs sent just on New Year’s Day 2017. The GIF button lets people search and post GIFs from different services, like Giphy and Tenor, directly in the comments box (on desktop browsers, the GIF button also displays trending GIFs, just like in Facebook Messenger).  Facebook added GIF support two years ago, but until now users had to enter the URL of a GIF hosted somewhere else. The GIF button makes the process a lot easier, especially on mobile. It’s currently only available for comments, but Facebook may eventually also make it available for News Feed posts because user demand for GIFs shows no signs of abating. Facebook reportedly had support for GIFs ready for years before it was finally added, but was hesitant to deploy it because of the visual impact it would have on the News Feed. Despite the company’s initial reluctance, however, users kept finding workarounds to post GIFs. The lack of GIF support also gave other services like Imgur an advantage. Now Facebook has started embracing News Feeds with “richer” (some would say busier) media and in addition to GIFs, that includes auto-play videos and colored statuses. For fun and to mark the anniversary of when GIFs were first introduced by CompuServe in 1987, Facebook is also running a poll asking users how GIF is pronounced, a debate that continues to rage on even though the creator of GIF, Steve Wilhite, has already declared his allegiance to the soft G.  \n",

            "217 Facebook teaches machines to negotiate with humans\n",
            "Though Facebook  is rarely mentioned alongside Apple, Microsoft and Amazon in discussions about conversational AI, the company has published a hoard of papers that underscore a deep interest in dialog systems. As has become clear with Siri, Cortana and Alexa, dialog is hard — it requires more than just good speech recognition to deliver a killer experience to users. From the sidelines Facebook has been tinkering with big challenges like natural language understanding and text generation. And today the Facebook AI Research team added to its portfolio with a paper bringing negotiation into the conversation (all puns intended). Facebook’s team smashed game theory together with deep learning to equip machines to negotiate with humans. By applying rollout techniques more commonly used in game-playing AIs to a dialog scenario, Facebook was able to create machines capable of complex bargaining. To start, Facebook dreamed up an imaginary negotiation scenario. Humans on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk were given an explicit value function and told to negotiate in natural language to maximize reward by splitting up a pot of random objects — five books, three hats and two balls. The game was capped at ten rounds of dialog, the rules stated that nobody would receive any reward if that limit was exceeded. Because each agent had distinct hidden preferences, the two had to engage in dialog to sort out which objects should be given to which agent. Over the course of the interactions, machines naturally adopted many common negotiation tactics — like placing false emphasis on a low-value item in an attempt to use it as a more valuable bargaining chip later. Under the hood, Facebook’s rollout technique takes the form of a decision tree. Decision trees are a critical component of many intelligent systems. They allow us to model future states from the present to make decisions. Imagine a game of tic-tac-toe, at any given point of the game, there is a finite option set (places you can place your “X” on the board. In that scenario, each move has an expected value. Humans don’t usually consider this value in an explicit way but if you decompose your decision process when playing the game, you are effectively short-handing this math in your head.  Games like Tic Tac Toe are simple enough that they can be completely solved in a decision tree. More complex games like Go and Chess require strategies and heuristics to reduce the total number of states (it’s an almost unimaginable number of possible states). But even Chess and Go are relatively simple compared to dialog. Dialog doesn’t draw from a finite set of outcomes. This means that for any question, there is an infinite number of possible human responses. To model a conversation, researchers have to take extra effort to bound the uncertainty problem into a reasonable size and scope. Opting to model a negotiation scheme makes this possible. The language itself can exist in an infinite number of states but its intent generally clusters around simple outcomes (I’ll take the deal or reject it). But even in a bounded world, it’s still difficult to get machines to interact with humans in a believable way. To this avail, Facebook trained its models on negotiations between pairs of people. Once this was done, the machines were set up to negotiate with each other using reinforcement learning. At the end of each round of conversation, agents received rewards to guide improvement. FAIR researchers Michael Lewis and Dhruv Batra explained to me that their algorithms were better at preventing individuals from making bad decisions than ensuring individuals made the best decisions. This is still important — the team told me to imagine a calendar application that doesn’t try to schedule meetings for the best time for everyone but instead tries to just ensure the meeting actually happens. As with a lot of research, the application of this technology isn’t necessarily as explicit as the scenario simulated for the paper. Engineers often employ adversarial relationships between machines to improve outcomes — think using generative adversarial networks to generate training data by having a machine generate data looking to fool another “gatekeeper” machine. Semi-cooperative, semi adversarial relationships, like the relationship between a coach and an athlete, could be an interesting next frontier — further connecting game theory and machine learning. Facebook has open sourced its code from this research project. If you’re interested, you can read additional details about the work in the full paper here.  \n",

            "218 Facebook’s Safety Check is a stress-inducing flip of social norms\n",
            "Facebook’s  Safety Check feature was activated today, following news that a fire had engulfed a 24-storey block of flats in West London. At least six people are reported to have died in the blaze, with police expecting the death toll to rise. The Grenfell tower contains 120 flats. Clearly this is a tragedy. But should Facebook be reacting to a tragedy by sending push alerts — including to users who are miles away from the building in question? Is that helpful? Or does it risk generating more stress than it is apparently supposed to relieve…  Being six miles away from a burning building in a city with a population of circa 8.5 million should not be a cause for worry — yet Facebook is actively encouraging users to worry by using emotive language (“your friends”) to nudge a public declaration of individual safety. And if someone doesn’t take action to “mark themselves safe”, as Facebook puts it, they risk their friends thinking they are somehow — against all rational odds — caught up in the tragic incident. Those same friends would likely not have even thought to consider there was any risk prior to the existence of the Facebook feature. This is the paradoxical panic of ‘Safety Check’. (A paradox Facebook itself has tacitly conceded even extends to people who mark themselves “safe” and then, by doing so, cause their friends to worry they are still somehow caught up in the incident — yet instead of retracting Safety Check, Facebook is now retrenching; bolting on more features, encouraging users to include a “personal note” with their check mark to contextualize how nothing actually happened to them… Yes, we are really witnessing feature creep on something that was billed as apparently providing passive reassurance… O____o ) Here’s the bottom line: London is a very large city. A blaze in a tower block is terrible, terrible news. It is also very, very unlikely to involve anyone who does not live in the building. Yet Facebook’s Safety Check algorithm is apparently unable to make anything approaching a sane assessment of relative risk. To compound matters, the company’s reliance on its own demonstrably unreliable geolocation technology to determine who gets a Safety Check prompt results in it spamming users who live hundreds of miles away — in totally different towns and cities (even apparently in different countries) — pointlessly pushing them to push a Safety Check button. This is indeed — as one Facebook user put it on Twitter — “massively irresponsible”.  As Tausif Noor has written, in an excellent essay on the collateral societal damage of a platform controlling whether we think our friends are safe or not, by “explicitly and institutionally entering into life-and-death matters, Facebook takes on new responsibilities for responding to them appropriately”. And, demonstrably, Facebook is not handling those responsibilities very well at all — not least by stepping away from making evidence-based decisions, on a case-by-case basis, of whether or not to activate Safety Check. The feature did start out as something Facebook manually switched on. But Facebook soon abandoned that decision-making role (sound familiar?) — including after facing criticism of Western bias in its assessment of terrorist incidents. Since last summer, the feature has been so-called ‘community activated’. What does that mean? It means Facebook relies on the following formula for activating Safety Check: First, global crisis reporting agencies NC4 and iJET International must alert it that an incident has occurred and give the incident a title (in this case, presumably, “the fire in London”); and secondly there has to be an unspecified volume of Facebook posts about the incident in an unspecified area in the vicinity of the incident. It is unclear how near an incident area a Facebook user has to be to trigger a Safety Check prompt, nor how many posts they have to have personally posted relating to the incident. We’ve asked Facebook for more clarity on its algorithmic criteria — but (as yet) received none. NC4 and iJET International also declined to provide specific details of how they work with Facebook to power the feature, with the latter company telling us: “This is proprietary information.” Putting Safety Check activation in this protective, semi-algorithmic swaddling means the company can cushion itself from blame when the feature is (or is not) activated — since it’s not making case-by-case decisions itself — yet also (apparently) sidestep the responsibility for its technology enabling widespread algorithmic stress. As is demonstrably the case here, where it’s been activated across London and beyond. People talking about a tragedy on Facebook seems a very noisy signal indeed to send a push notification nudging users to make individual declarations of personal safety. Add to that, as we can see from how hit and miss the London fire-related prompts are, Facebook’s geolocation smarts are very far from perfect. If your margin of location-positioning error extends to triggering alerts in other cities hundreds of miles away (not to mention other countries!) your technology is very clearly not fit for purpose. Even six miles in a city of ~8.5M people indicates a ridiculously blunt instrument being wielded here. Yet one that also has an emotional impact. The wider question is whether Facebook should be seeking to control user behavior by manufacturing a featured ‘public safety’ expectation at all. There is zero need for a Safety Check feature. People could still use Facebook to post a status update saying they’re fine if they feel the need to — or indeed, use Facebook (or WhatsApp or email etc) to reach out directly to friends to ask if they’re okay — again if they feel the need to. But by making Safety Check a default expectation Facebook flips the norms of societal behavior and suddenly no one can feel safe unless everyone has manually checked the Facebook box marked “safe”. This is ludicrous. Facebook itself says Safety Check has been activated more than 600 times in two years — with more than a billion “safety” notifications triggered by users over that period. Yet how many of those notifications were really merited? And how many salved more worries than they caused? It’s clear the algorithmically triggered Safety Check is a far more hysterical creature than the manual version. Last November CNET reported that Facebook had only turned on Safety Check 39 times in the prior two years vs 335 events being flagged by the community-based version of the tool since it had started testing it in June. The problem is social media is intended as — and engineered to be — a public discussion forum. News events demonstrably ripple across these platforms in waves of public communication. Those waves of chatter should not be misconstrued as evidence of risk. But it sure looks like that’s what Facebook’s Safety Check is doing. While the company likely had the best of intentions in developing the feature, which after all grew out of organic site usage following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the result at this point looks like an insensible hair-trigger that encourages people to overreact to tragic events when the sane and rational response would actually be the opposite: stay calm and don’t worry unless you hear otherwise. Aka: Keep calm and carry on. Safety Check also compels everyone, willing or otherwise, to engage with a single commercial platform every time some kind of major (or relatively minor) public safety incident occurs — or else worry about causing unnecessary worry for friends and family. This is especially problematic when you consider Facebook’s business model benefits from increased engagement with its platform. Add to that, it also recently stepped into the personal fundraising space. And today, as chance would have it, Facebook announced that Safety Check will be integrating these personal fundraisers (starting in the US). An FAQ for Facebook’s Fundraisers notes that the company levies a fee for personal donations of 6.9% + $.30, while fees for nonprofit donations range from 5% to 5.75%. (The company claims these fees are to cover credit card processing and to fund internal teams conducting fraud review of fundraisers.) It’s not clear whether Facebook will be levying the same fee structure on Fundraisers that are specifically associated with incidents where Safety Check has also been triggered — we’ve asked but at the time of writing the company had not responded. If so, Facebook is directly linking its behavioral nudging of users, via Safety Check, with a revenue generating feature that will let it take a cut of any money raised to help victims of the same tragedies. That makes its irresponsibility in apparently encouraging public worry look like something rather more cynically opportunistic. Checking in on my own London friends, Facebook’s Safety Check informs me that three are “safe” from the tower block fire. However 97 are worryingly labelled “not marked as safe yet”. The only sane response to that is: Facebook Safety Check, close your account.

            "219 Facebook’s Safety Check will integrate fundraisers, among other upgrades\n",
            "Facebook  today announced a series of improvements for its Safety Check feature – the service that allows Facebook users to communicate about their safety to friends and family during a crisis. Most notably, people will now have the option to start fundraisers from within Safety Check, in order to immediately translate concern for victims of a crisis or natural disaster into specific actions. Additionally, the service is being expanded to include more information about a crisis and the option to leave a personal note along with their Safety Check News Feed story. Plus, the Community Help feature, launched earlier this year on mobile as a way for people to find and give help like food, shelter and transportation, is now making its way to the desktop.  Facebook has been steadily expanding access to fundraisers over the course of the past several months, so it makes sense that it would now bring this service to Safety Check. In March, the company introduced the ability for people to create personal fundraisers – a move that put the feature in direct competition with GoFundMe. Facebook’s personal fundraising service exited beta in May, while also adding support for raising funds for sports teams and communities. According to Facebook, fundraisers’ integration into Safety Check will allow people to both create and donate to charitable and personal causes to help those in need, in the wake of a crisis. That means those who aren’t in the affected area can contribute. However, the feature isn’t immediately available. It’s initially rolling out in the “coming weeks” here in the U.S., the company says. In other words, it won’t be an option to help the currently active Safety Check for those in London affected by the large high-rise fire at Grenfell Tower, which killed at least six (as of the time of writing) and injured 74. Fundraisers are a potentially big business for Facebook, if it’s able to shift more of the activity taking place on GoFundMe over to its own social network – a strong possibility, as it’s undercutting GoFundMe’s fees. Facebook’s personal fundraisers have a 6.9 percent + $.30 fee that goes to payment processing, fundraiser vetting, and security and fraud protection. GoFundMe takes 7.9 percent + $.30 for personal or charity campaigns, by comparison. (Facebook nonprofit fundraisers, meanwhile, have fees of 5 percent to 5.75 percent.) By connecting fundraisers to large-scale events through Safety Check, Facebook fundraisers will gain even more attention and see increased use going forward. Already, fundraising around crises has been taking place on Facebook. For example, after the Manchester attack in May, people donated over $450,000 to help the community via Facebook.  This will be aided by the rollout of crisis descriptions, also newly announced today. These descriptions will help people better understand the situation which may then further inspire them to help. Facebook says it’s working with NC4, a trusted third-party global crisis reporting agency, in order to add descriptions about the crisis to Safety Check notifications. Finally, Safety Check will also now become a way for people to share their own stories with friends and family, rather than the simple utility for marking themselves safe, as in the past. Starting now, people can choose to share additional information through a personal note when they use the Safety Check tool. This note, along with their Safety Check status, is shared automatically to the News Feed as people mark themselves Safe. This goes to address one of the issues with Safety Check – that it sometimes caused loved ones’ fear, rather than alleviating their concerns. Facebook product designer Preethi Chenan explained the problem, noting that simply by marking themselves “safe,” some people had worried their families and friends who then thought they had been more directly affected by the crisis. Now users can add a note, to add reassurance that they are in no way in danger.  Facebook says Safety Check has been activated over 600 times over the course of the past two years. That number will likely continue to climb since last summer’s introduction of the community-activated Safety Check feature. The company said then it was working to bring the feature to more events, by automating a way for the network to trigger Safety Check when a certain number of people begin posting to Facebook about a crisis that can be verified by a third-party source. Fundraisers and desktop support for Community Help are arriving in the weeks ahead. Personal notes and crisis descriptions for Safety Check are rolling out now.  \n",

            "Any technology that only works in English neglects 75% of the world. That problem is especially severe for Facebook  with its global userbase. Yet most languages are being left out by the advances in artificial intelligence centered around natural language processing led by researchers in the U.S. and China. But today marks a milestone for AI accessibility. Facebook Messenger’s  artificial intelligence assistant “M” can now make recommendations in Spanish of Messenger features to use if it detects that that’s the language someone writes in. M Suggests rolled them out in English two months ago.  The feature scans the words and intent of your messages, then pops up optional suggestions from Messenger’s many features. Say “Te debo $20” and M suggests the payments feature. Write “Besos!” and it will surface lovey-dovey stickers you can send. Ask “¿Dónde estás?” and M pulls up the location sharing feature. M Suggestions are now available to all Facebook users with their language set to Spanish in the US, and the feature is rolling out in Mexico. Last year Facebook added a multilingual sharing button so Pages can post in one language and have it appear to people in their native tongues. And now well over 800 million users see translated News Feed posts each month after Facebook dropped Bing to focus on strengthening the AI behind its own translation technology. Hopefully the next step for Messenger will be real-time translation for conversation partners across languages, that way we can connect, cooperate, and commiserate with people from different cultures. We fear what we don’t understand. But if Facebook’s translation tech can show us just how similar we are to people from other countries, it could promote tolerance between all humans.  \n",

            "There’s disturbing news from Pakistan, where a man has been handed the death sentence for allegedly making blasphemous comments on Facebook. The Guardian reports that Taimoor Raza was founded guilty of insulting the prophet Muhammad by a court this week. His charge relates to comments made during a debate about Islam with another user on the social network, who subsequently turned out to be an undercover counter-terrorism agent. This is the stiffest punishment that Pakistan has handed down for online comments to date. The ruling is part of a wider crackdown on blasphemous material on the internet. Pakistani authorities have pushed Google, Facebook and others to identify users posting such comments online, and they even asked their own citizens to be vigilant of posts made by others. “The casual manner in which death sentences are handed in blasphemy cases coupled with the lack of orientation of Pakistani courts with technology makes this a very dangerous situation,” Human Rights Watch representative Saroop Ijaz told The Guardian  in a statement. In years past, Pakistan has issued temporary blocks on Facebook, and then Twitter. A three-year ban on YouTube was lifted last year.  \n",

            "A man in Thailand has been sentenced to 35 years in prison after he was found guilty of insulting the country’s royal family on Facebook . Identified only as Wichai, he is alleged to have published 10 photos, videos and comments on the social network that violate Thailand’s strict lèse majesté regulations that outlaw criticism of the royal family, according to free speech group iLaw. The 33-year-old is accused of creating the posts using a “fraudulent” account that purportedly impersonated a former friend with whom he had quarreled. Wichai initially denied the charges but, after spending more than a year in jail while the case was processed, he changed his response and confessed, iLaw said. Journalists were banned from attending the hearing today, which took place in a military court. Initially, the court prescribed seven years per offense, but it subsequently reduced the overall sentence from 70 years to 35 years. Nonetheless, this is a record sentence for the Thai law, which the UN has called “incompatible with international human rights law.” In a separate case, iLaw added that another man — “Chaliew” — was given 2.5 years in jail for posting a clip from a radio program to a file-sharing site in 2014. The clip was judged to have defamed the monarchy. Thailand has been criticized for its use of lèse majesté and other censorship strategies since the military seized control of the government via a coup three years ago. Human rights group FIDH reported that the total number of people arrested under lèse majesté following the coup passed 100 last month. Today’s ruling is not the first instance of jail time given to a person for Facebook comments, likes or even just receiving a message. It even outlawed online interaction with three overseas-based critics of the current regime. More broadly, the government has pressed ahead with controversial plans to implement a single internet gateway that would simplify online censorship. That’s because the current system requires participation from overseas content platforms, which are reluctant to censor their users. Recently, the Thai government has put pressure on social networks themselves to clean up illegal content. Facebook has begun to block posts directly when a court orders it to, and, this year, it and YouTube both deleted hundreds of URLs that were deemed to be illegal in the country. However, officials were not satisfied that many links remained, and the ruling junta issued a threat to ban access to Facebook over the issue. However, it backed down on that and Facebook remains accessible in the country. All of this, and more, explains why online freedom groups are increasingly concerned about Thailand. In its 2016 report, U.S.-based Freedom House concluded that Thailand’s internet and media are “not free.” “Internet freedom declined in 2016 as the military leadership continued its efforts to codify censorship and surveillance powers through legislation,” the group wrote.  \n",

            "Facebook is finally getting office space in San Francisco, and is currently considering several different locations, one of which will house up to 100 Instagram  employees, an industry source familiar with the lease plan confirmed to TechCrunch. Earlier today, The Registry reported Facebook is in talks for a space at 181 Fremont in the South of Market district — a 70-story tower that won’t open until early next year. Our source confirmed this is one of the buildings Facebook is choosing from, though there are other options it’s looking at and no lease has been signed yet. Instagram has a giant light-up logo in front of its current Menlo Park office. Image by Vocino Facebook is considering this a “test” or “pilot” of San Francisco office space, our source said, so don’t expect it to suddenly relocate its massive Menlo Park headquarters from Silicon Valley up to the city. Facebook has offices in 68 cities around the world, yet has had to resort to holding SF meetings at its PR company OutCast’s offices. Having an SF office could help Instagram’s recruiting effort because employees who live in the city wouldn’t have to endure the hour-plus shuttle ride to Instagram’s current Menlo Park headquarter’s that’s a mile from the main Facebook campus. Traffic has grown worse and worse in the Bay Area as startups flock to the region, giving companies located in SF a recruiting edge by being able to dangle a short subway ride, Uber or walk to work. Instagram’s Menlo Park office features elaborate photo backdrops. Image via CarinaJXT Many employees at Facebook and Instagram I’ve spoken to loathe the commute, and some who have left for companies in the city like Uber or Twitter cite the shorter commute as a big draw. For younger, more extroverted tech workers, living in San Francisco offers a much more culturally rich experience than the hollow hills and office parks of the South Bay. Only a portion of Instagram’s 500 employees would fit in the new SF space, and our source didn’t know which team or projects would be centered there. But if Instagram does see its recruitment improve thanks to the office in SF, Facebook might consider expanding this “pilot” with more offices there. You can expect plenty of jockeying between Instagram employees for those few SF desks.  \n",

            "224 Facebook is speeding up training for visual recognition models\n",
            "Every minute spent training a deep learning model is a minute not doing something else, and in today’s fast-paced world of research, that minute is worth a lot. Facebook  published a paper this morning detailing its personal approach to this problem. The company says it has managed to reduce the training time of a ResNet-50 deep learning model on ImageNet from 29 hours to one. Facebook managed to reduce training time so dramatically by distributing training in larger “minibatches” across a greater number of GPUs. In the previous benchmark case, batches of 256 images were spread across eight GPUs. But today’s work involves batch sizes of 8,192 images distributed across 256 GPUs. Most people don’t have 256 GPUs lying around, but big tech companies and well-funded research groups do. Being able to scale training across so many GPUs to reduce training time, without a dramatic loss in accuracy, is a big deal. The team slowed down learning rates at the beginning stages of the training process to overcome some of the difficulties that made large batch sizes previously infeasible. Without getting too lost in the details, stochastic gradient descent is used to train the ResNet-50 model. One of the key variables in stochastic gradient descent is the learning rate — the degree by which weights change during the training process. The way this variable changes as minibatch size changes is the key to optimizing effectively. Machine learning developers spend their days dealing with compromises. Greater accuracy often requires larger data sets that demand additional training time and compute resources. In this vein, it would be possible to prioritize accuracy or speed to achieve more impressive results, but training a model with poor accuracy in 20 seconds isn’t super valuable. Unlike most research projects, Facebook’s AI Research (FAIR) and Applied Machine Learning (AML) teams worked side by side on increasing minibatch sizes. From here the groups plan to investigate some of the additional questions generated from today’s work. “This work throws out more questions than it answers,” said Pieter Noordhuis, a member of Facebook’s AML team. “There’s a tipping point beyond 8,000 images where error rates go up again and we don’t know why.” Facebook used Caffe2, its open source deep learning framework, and its Big Basin GPU servers for this experiment.

            "Earlier this year, Facebook  announced it would allow publishers to include more ads in their “Instant Articles” — the mobile web format that makes news articles load more quickly on Facebook, but have been called out by publishers whose ad-dependent businesses suffered as a result. In March, Facebook began testing ad units at the bottom of Instant Article pages — in the related articles section. Today, that test is opening to all publishers on the network, says Facebook. The test involves placing a native ad unit in Instant Articles that shows readers relevant ads from Facebook’s own advertisers. According to Facebook, the initial test saw an “incremental increase” in revenue for participating publishers, but it didn’t get into specific numbers. The company now says it’s looking to get feedback from a wider set of publishers about this unit in order to iterate on the experience. The company’s Instant Articles — Facebook’s counterpoint to other technologies like Google’s AMP or Apple’s News format — are designed to make it easier to read publishers’ content while on the mobile web. All these technologies, at their core, are about stripping down articles to just what a reader is interested in — the text and accompanying media, like photos — without all the cruft publishers have piled on over the years, like ad units, autoplaying videos, tracking scripts and more. However, publishers haven’t liked this shift to a cleaned-up mobile web, because all that extra “stuff” layered on their websites is what helps them pay their bills. They need advertisers, paying subscribers, event attendees and the like in order to grow their businesses. That’s led Facebook to have to make several concessions to keep their Instant Articles snappy to load, while also catering to publishers’ need to actually make money. The company has steadily been tweaking the rules for Instant Articles in recent months — allowing them to show more ads; or rolling out new features, like call-to-action units in the articles that can promote email sign-ups or request Page Likes; or letting publishers push free trials and app downloads, among other things. It also last month rolled out an SDK extension that would allow publishers to create articles for Google AMP and Apple News at the same time as they create Facebook Instant Articles. But a number of high-profile publishers had enough, and have abandoned Facebook’s format. In April, Forbes, Hearst, The New York Times and others, including The Guardian, backed out of Instant Articles. Meanwhile, other major media organizations like Bloomberg, The WSJ, ESPN, CBS News, NPR, Financial Times and VICE News have been holdouts, running little to no content in Facebook’s format, it’s been reported. Despite these setbacks, Facebook says today that adoption of Instant Articles is growing. There are now more than 10,000 publishers worldwide using the format — a figure that’s up 25 percent over the last six months. A third of all clicks to articles on Facebook are now to Instant Articles, Facebook also notes. And, in aggregate, Instant Articles deliver 20 percent to 50 percent more traffic, as compared with the mobile web. In addition, Facebook says its investments in things like those call-to-action units, new types of ads and changes to where ads can be placed have begun to pay off. Instant Articles now pays out more than $1 million per day to publishers via Facebook Audience Network. And, in the last six months, RPM (revenue per 1,000 page views) that publishers see from Facebook Audience Network in Instant Articles has increased by more than 50 percent, the company says.  \n",

            "226 Facebook will share anonymized location data with disaster relief organizations\n",
            "A new initiative from Facebook  will provide aid organizations with location data for users in affected areas, such as where people are marking themselves safe and from where they are fleeing. It shows the immense potential of this kind of fine-grained tracking, but inescapably resurfaces questions of just what else the company could do with the data. In a blog post and video, Facebook’s public policy research manager Molly Jackman describes the new “disaster maps” that will be provided to UNICEF, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, and the World Food Program to start. Essentially there will be three types of information provided — sourced, presumably, from GPS and other location indicators provided whenever a Facebook user does just about anything. Location density maps will provide rough but recent estimations of where people are distributed, which can be compared to earlier such maps or other measures. Movement maps show how users changed locations, from neighborhood to neighborhood or city to city, and when — this could help direct urgent resources to ad hoc gathering spots or bottlenecks. Safety Check maps show where people have marked themselves safe; if they’re clustering in one area, that may be indicate the limits of a flood’s effects, or a region undamaged by an earthquake. One can easily imagine how useful this type of up-to-date information could be to anyone trying to figure out where to send fresh water, set up emergency shelters and so on. Of course, the data is aggregated and de-identified, and the partner organizations must “respect our privacy standards,” Jackman wrote. But on the other hand, when Facebook flexes its data muscles for good like this, suspicious minds begin to think along other lines. What other kinds of population movements does Facebook track, perhaps to better inform advertisers? How can users know if their location is being roped into this kind of experimental data silo? Does this include information gleaned from Facebook plug-ins and cookies? Who has access to the data, and at what level of granularity and de-identification? The company is under no formal obligation to explain itself, and I don’t want to suggest any ill purpose exactly. But it’s always troubling when, given a tool that can very easily be used for both humanitarian purposes and self-serving ones, we only hear about the former. As usual, unless Facebook and other major data hoarders like Google specifically say they aren’t using your data for something, it’s best to assume that they are.  \n",

            "227 Facebook inserts itself into politics with new tools that help elected officials reach constituents\n",
            "Facebook  this year has launched a number of features that make it easier for people to reach their government representatives on its social network, including “Town Hall,” and related integrations with News Feed, as well as ways to share reps’ contact info in your own posts. Today, the company is expanding on these initiatives with those designed for elected officials themselves. The new tools will help officials connect with their constituents, as well as better understand which issues their constituents care about most. Specifically, the social network is rolling out three new features: constituent badges, constituent insights, and district targeting. Constituent badges are a new, opt-in feature that allow Facebook users to identify themselves as a person living in the district the elected official represents. Facebook determines whether or not someone is a constituent based on the address information provided either in Town Hall, or as part of the process used to turn on the badges.  Constituent Badges Posted by Facebook on Wednesday, June 7, 2017 While anyone could enter a fake address and pretend to be a constituent, Facebook has put controls in place to limit those bad actors. For starters, Facebook users can only be a verified constituent based on one address at a time – and, if a person changes their address, their badge is removed from prior posts. Facebook also limits the number of times an address can be changed, we understand. The idea with the badges is to make it easier for elected officials to determine which Facebook comments, questions and concerns are being shared by those they actually represent. Whether or not they’ll treat these sentiments with the same degree of importance as they would a phone call, email, or letter remains to be seen. Facebook users will be prompted to turn on constituent badges when they like or comment on posts by their reps through a unit that appears on the page. Alternately, users can go to the Town Hall section on Facebook to turn on the badge themselves. Once enabled, badges will appear anytime a person comments on content shared by their own representatives.  A second feature called Constituent Insights is designed to help elected officials learn which local news stories and content is popular in their district, so they can share their thoughts on those matters. This will be available to the reps through a new Page Insights feature, available to Page admins, which includes a horizontally scrollable section where locally trending news stories appear. Here, the elected officials can click a link to post that story to their Facebook Page, along with their thoughts on the issue. Additionally, constituents will be able to browse through these same stories on a new Community tab on the official’s Facebook Page. The third new feature – District Targeting – is arguably the most notable. This effectively gives elected officials the means of gathering feedback from their constituents through Facebook directly, using either posts or polls that are targeted only towards those who actually live in their particular district. That means the official can post to Facebook to ask for feedback from constituents about an issue, and these posts will only be viewable by those who live in their district. Of course, this also means that the elected official would be taking an active – even proactive – role in engaging with their community and constituent base, rather than waiting for constituents to reach out to their office with their thoughts, as is often the case today. Overall, the combination of Town Hall with these new features aimed at government officials represent a growing effort at Facebook to become more involved in the political process and the dialog surrounding policy issues.  The changes also follow Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s nearly 6,000-word manifesto on Facebook earlier this year where he discussed a number of ambitions for the social network in the days ahead, including one focused on how Facebook could be used to increase civic engagement. In part, these moves are a reaction to the role Facebook played in the U.S. elections, where it did nothing to curb the widespread sharing of disinformation across its network – something that many have claimed helped contribute to Trump’s win. On that front, Facebook has rolled out a number of new controls, include things like PSAs in the News Feed about how to identify fake news stories; displays of related articles and fact checkers before links are opened; displays of alternative news sources in its Trending section: and it’s  downranking fake news stories to make them less visible. Meanwhile, it has also rolled out features to help Facebook users become more politically engaged (instead of just enraged), by helping them find and contact reps, and more. Facebook says all three new features are rolling out starting today.  \n",

            "Over 38 million people in the US are deaf or hard-of-hearing, and Facebook wants them to be able to watch the 1 in 5 of its videos that are broadcast live. So today it’s taking the first step towards making Facebook  Live more accessible by allowing publishers to create and stream closed captions for their Live videos either on their own or with the help of a technology vendor like Ai-Media or Telestream However, Facebook isn’t offering automatic closed captioning through its tech the way it does for free for recorded and uploaded Page videos. That would significantly increase the coverage of captions on Live videos, but could be prohibitively difficult or expensive to offer in at scale in the low-latency real-time nature necessary for Live broadcasts. Instead, only publishers using the Live API that generate CEA-608 standard closed captions or work with a vendor who does will be able to add subtitles.  “Making Facebook accessible to everyone is a key part of building global community” write Facebook product manager Supratik Lahiri, and director of accessibility Jeffrey Wieland. These captions will appear to users on both mobile and desktop if they enable the setting. The 360 million people world-wide who are hard-of-hearing aren’t a small niche that Facebook can ignore. In fact, they present a sizeable growth opportunity. If Facebook can use closed captioning to get them watching videos, they’ll spend more time connecting with people on its apps, and see more ads that generate revenue. For comparison, Twitter lacks any closed captioning ability beyond video publishers including them already overlaid in their uploads. Snapchat added a formal closed caption option to Discover last year. YouTube was a pioneer, adding closed captions in 2006 and automatic speech recognition-based captioning a few years later. It’s since expanded to Live videos and more languages. But closed captions can be inaccurate, especially for Live broadcasts, as Facebook discovered this month when Harvard’s faulty system spawned plenty of jokes during Mark Zuckerberg’s commencement speech.    https://twitter.com/mcwm/status/867830516380307457/photo/1 So perhaps it’s for the best that Facebook isn’t trying to assume the responsibility for accurate Live captioning just yet. But as its speech recognition improves and its tech scales, it might be able to make every Live video more accessible.

            "229 Facebook now lets you find and contact your government reps right from your posts\n",
            "Facebook  has launched a new feature that makes it easier for users to share their views with their elected government officials directly from a Facebook post. In the “Compose” window that pops up when you prepare to write a post, there’s now a new option that lets you search for and add your representatives’ information to your post. The idea is that as you’re expressing your political views on a matter via a Facebook post, you can share that you’re contacting your representative about the matter and encourage your family, friends and followers to do the same. The feature is available to both individual users and Facebook Page owners, as you can see in the screenshots below. Our own TechCrunch account was able to access the option through a dedicated icon in the Compose window. However, on individual profile pages, it’s been integrated into the “Feelings & Activities” section under the option “Contacting…”   Above: contacting government reps from a Page  Above: contacting government reps from a profile The feature, which is available on both web and mobile, doesn’t really tag the government rep in question or alert them to your post. But it makes reaching out to your rep via Facebook only a click away, by attaching their names, titles and a contact button to your Facebook post. This is the latest addition to Facebook’s Town Hall platform — a recently launched initiative designed to make it easier for Facebook users to locate, follow and contact their local, state and federal government representatives via the social network.  Town Hall officially launched to all U.S. users in March, where it’s available from Facebook’s menu navigation, as well as through various integrations with the News Feed. For example, Facebook previously introduced a feature that invites you to call, message or email your rep when you like or comment on one of their posts. You could then share a post to your own profile alerting your friends of your political action. Before now, these sorts of Town Hall features were only available to those who were already engaging with their government representatives on Facebook, or who were actively seeking their reps’ information. With the new integration into the “Compose” box, users who may have otherwise been just sharing their own personal, political opinions may now be encouraged to take action — and prompt others to do so, as well. “This feature makes it easier for people with common interests to share their views with their elected representatives,” a Facebook spokesperson explained. Facebook first began rolling out the integration in the Compose box in early May, the company tells us. It reached all users in the U.S. as of last week.  \n",

            "Facebook  shareholders have once again rejected a proposal for Facebook to prepare a gender pay equity report to assess pay between men and women across race and ethnicity. A stockholder proposal called for Facebook to prepare a report by December 2017 around the company’s policies and goals to reduce the gender pay gap. Shareholders rejected a similar proposal last year. Facebook, whose board of directors recommended a vote against the proposal, argued that it has already been reviewing compensation fairness to ensure pay equity for years. This past April, for example, Facebook VP of People Lori Goler highlighted Facebook’s internal processes to ensure there is equal pay at the company. “Given our ongoing compensation practices and diversity efforts, and that we have previously shared that we have pay parity, our board of directors believes that the preparation of the report contemplated by this proposal is unnecessary and not beneficial to our stockholder,” Facebook wrote in its opposing statement. However, as noted on Facebook’s annual shareholder call today by Natasha Lamb, managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a 2014 Glassdoor study found that female software engineers at Facebook make $5,949 less than their male counterparts. Lamb went on to say that Facebook is put at a competitive disadvantage by not showing leadership in this area, noting how tech companies like Intel and Apple have conducted in-depth reports to assess pay equity. The tech industry’s gender gap is close to the U.S. average (5.4 percent), and falls in the middle among industries, according to a 2016 Glassdoor study.  Meanwhile, Google is currently battling it out with the Department of Labor over allegations of pay disparities between men and women.  \n",

            "Facebook  is revamping its photo album feature with the ability to add videos, check-ins, text posts to albums, follow friends’ albums so you’re notified when they’re updated, and display “featured” albums on your profile to highlight your favorite collections. Facebook is also simplifying the ability to add contributors to a collaborative album, which was an option added in 2013 but deeply buried in the product. The update rolls out to Android and web today, with iOS coming soon. Create albums with more than just photos, easily allow friends to contribute, feature albums on your profile, and follow albums for notifications about new additions Facebook described the purpose of the update to TechCrunch, writing “Gone on a surf trip recently? Share videos of you tacking your waves, your check-in at the pier, a photo of your board and more – in a single album.” Giving albums more flexibility could help Facebook stave off the newly invigorated assault from Google Photos. Google can now store all your photos for free, detect who’s in them and suggest sharing with them, automatically share photos with your closest friends or family, and let you search your library by keyword using machine vision. Those features approximate some of what’s available in Facebook’s photo sharing app Moments. With this update, Facebook hopes to differentiate itself by allowing you to organize more than just photos in albums, drawing on its vibrant social network that Google lacks since G+ flopped. The new feature essentially lets you create digital scrapbooks of all kinds of content. That raises the question of whether Facebook will start letting you create, print, and buy physical photo books from it the way Google does now.  \n",

            "232 Facebook’s Instant Articles platform to support Google AMP, Apple News\n",
            "One of the problems publishers face today in making their content more readable on mobile devices is that there are multiple, competing formats available for this purpose. Facebook has Instant Articles, Google is spearheading the AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) project, and the Apple News Format optimizes content for iOS devices. Facebook is today taking a crack at a solution to this problem by rolling out support for both AMP and soon Apple News as a part of its open source Instant Articles software development kit. The updated SDK will now include an extension that lets publishers build content that’s publishable in all three formats, beginning with support for Google’s AMP in addition to Facebook’s own Instant Articles. In the weeks ahead it will also include support for publishing to Apple News, though the company didn’t provide an exact launch date for when that feature would be added. At a high level, the SDK will take the markup that’s used to build Facebook’s Instant Articles and use it to create the code that’s needed to build for AMP and Apple News. While the multiple systems aren’t identical, of course, Facebook says it will offer ways for publishers to apply the custom styling templates for the competing services – including the application of things like custom fonts, colors, and captions, which will be mirrored as closely as possible in the other formats. The goal with this change is to offer a design once, publish anywhere experience – and naturally it’s one where publishing to Facebook is the first priority, in terms of getting things right. The functionality will be made available through an extension to the Facebook Instant Articles SDK, which is found here on Github. (Documentation on its usage is on the Facebook for Developers site, here.) The idea for the extension came about as part of the Facebook Journalism Project, a program that aims to connect Facebook with media publishers to help inform the company’s roadmap for upcoming news features on its site. The project’s other ideas include things like letting publishers offer free trials to their paid subscriptions via Facebook, hackathons with publishers’ development teams, digest packages that Facebook users can subscribe to, PSAs to promote news literacy across Facebook, tutorials for journalists, and more. However, the extension’s launch also comes at a time when a number of high-profile publishers have begun to abandon Facebook’s format, due to its lack of monetization options. In April, for example, it was reported that Forbes, Hearst, The New York Times and others have backed out of Instant Articles. Other major media organizations including Bloomberg, The WSJ, ESPN, CBS News, NPR, Financial Times, and VICE News have also been holdouts, running little to no content in Facebook’s format. Others who have used the format have been winding down their support; and last month, The Guardian pulled out of both Facebook’s Instant Articles and Apple News. Publishers are generally unhappy with the deals the platforms are cutting on revenue sharing, and don’t like that the Instant Article format prevents them from having a more direct relationship with their readers. Sending visitors to stripped down, mobile-optimized pages may be a good experience for readers who don’t have to deal with pop-ups and other clutter, but it has historically meant that publishers can’t serve all the same advertisements as on the web, nor encourage donations, push paid subscriptions, promote their email newsletters or events, or make other connections with readers. Facebook has tried to stem some of these concerns by tweaking the rules for Instant Articles – allowing them to show more ads, for example, or by rolling out new features, like call-to-action units in the articles that can promote email sign-ups or request Page Likes. It lets publishers push free trials and app downloads, among other things. Now, by tying Facebook Instant Articles to AMP and Apple News, the company hopes that it can lure publishers back to its platform by making it possible to publish to all three major services at once. But without fully loosening its restrictions, Facebook may still have a hard time making the case for Instant Articles, if the format doesn’t match up with publishers’ larger goals.  \n",

            "233 Facebook shrinks filter bubbles with alternate news sources in Trending\n",
            "You’re vulnerable to bias and polarization if you only get your news from one source. So instead of highlighting a single news outlet when you click through to a Trending topic, Facebook will now show a carousel of the other most popular articles written about the subject by different publishers. Meanwhile, Facebook  is giving more exposure to Trending Topics on mobile. Rather than only show Trending topics in the drop-down when you go to search for something on Facebook’s mobile app, the company will test showing a box with the top three current Trending topics inside the News Feed. This way people will more likely discover Trending content on mobile when previously it was buried in an unintuitive spot.  Facebook tells TechCrunch that the Trending sources carousel isn’t personalized to purposefully show you publishers you don’t follow or that might have a contrasting view point to what you typically click and share. But by swiping through to different news sources that you don’t follow, the company says it could show you different view points on the same topic. Of course that could backfire by showing you more biased sources than you’d normally read. Not every fact needs an “alternative” take. That can lead to misguided hot takes and senseless contrarianism. Facebook will have to keep an algorithmic eye on what publishers it shows in these carousels. Since Trump was elected, Facebook has been criticized for widening the political divide in America. Instead of more generalist media, the News Feed allows people to create their own newspaper from the sources they prefer. But if someone is lured into following biased or sensational sources, and surrounds themselves with friends who do the same along the same political pole, they can have misinformed views reinforced. Facebook tests a way to follow topics rather than specific publishers Mark Zuckerberg likes to cite a study by Facebook from 2015 that showed 23 percent of users’ friends are of the opposite political affiliation, while almost 29 percent of stories in the News Feed display views that disagree with a user’s ideology. But having 70%+ of your feed stoking your existing beliefs can still be problematic. In Zuckerberg’s humanitarian manifesto, he wrote that one solution was “to show a range of perspectives, let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right.” Facebook recently tried another approach to deflating these filter bubbles by letting people follow a topic and then see posts from a variety of publishers about it instead of just following individual publishers. Today’s update furthers that effort. Even if Facebook doesn’t truly believe filter bubbles are a massive problem, it needs the News Feed to be perceived as a positive fountainhead of information to stay at the center of people’s web browsing habits.  \n",

            "234 Facebook’s personal fundraisers exit beta, now support raising money for sports teams & communities\n",
            "Facebook  announced today it’s expanding its online fundraising tools – basically, Facebook’s own take on a GoFundMe-type service – to include support for community fundraisers as well as those for sports teams. The company had first launched its personal fundraising tools in March of this year, allowing users to raise money for educational, medical or pet medical needs, public crises, natural disasters, personal emergencies, and funerals or loss. That launch, however, was considered a beta test. Today, Facebook says the product is publicly available for all users in the U.S. who are over 18 years of age. With the new supported categories, Facebook users are now able to raise money for things like  neighborhood services, community improvements, or environmental improvements, Facebook explains. Or, in the case of sports teams, people can raise money for equipment, competitions or team fees. All fundraisers have to first go through a review process to ensure they meet Facebook’s policy and guidelines. Afterwards, users can promote their fundraising campaign by inviting friends to join and donate, or by posting the campaign to Facebook.  Personal Fundraisers Posted by Facebook on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 The launch of personal fundraisers follows a series of other efforts Facebook has made in the fundraising space. The company rolled out a Kickstarter-like feature in 2015 aimed at nonprofits, which allowed the organizations to set up a campaign page, explain their goals and collect cash. And in 2016, Facebook expanded its fundraising tools so individuals could collect funds on behalf of nonprofit organizations, too. The company then moved directly into GoFundMe’s space this March, even undercutting its rival on the fee structure. Facebook’s personal fundraisers have a 6.9 percent + $.30 fee that goes to payment processing, fundraiser vetting, and security and fraud protection. GoFundMe, meanwhile, takes 7.9 percent + $.30 for personal or charity campaigns. Facebook touts its lower price point as coming from a desire to encourage giving and good works on its network. “Facebook’s goal is to create a platform for good that’s sustainable over the long-term, and not to make a profit from our charitable giving tools,” the company said in today’s announcement. However, the fundraisers have another advantage for the social network. By giving to fundraisers, Facebook is encouraging more payment transactions among its user base – and payments is an area of its business that’s still under-developed today, despite Facebook having added support for person-to-person payments in Messenger. Access to personal fundraisers are open to all as of now, and can be found via facebook.com/fundraisers on the desktop, or from the “Fundraisers” menu on mobile devices.  \n",

            "235 Taboola intros Facebook-style ‘news feed’ to target mobile users with more links\n",
            "Taboola,  the startup that works with hundreds of publishers to provide a set of links at the bottom of pages directing readers to more content on the site and elsewhere, has long positioned Facebook as the big competitor. Consumers scanning articles on Facebook, especially on mobile, are less likely to ever visit a publisher’s own site, even more so now with the introduction of Instant Articles that keep readers essentially inside the Facebook experience: hence the push to create more links at the bottoms of stories to try to keep readers engaged and in your own network sphere. Now, in an ironic twist, Taboola is launching a new format that could be summed up as “if you can’t beat them, join them”. As an alternative to its existing grid of links, Taboola wants now to feature content recommendations in the form of a continuously scrolling list, its own take on, yes, Facebook’s news feed. The new format is launching first with the New York Daily News before getting rolled out to other publications. The new Taboola news feed essentially consolidates a number of widgets and links you already have on websites, specifically publishers’ websites, into a larger feed experience: alongside the links to other articles on your own site, and those of other publications in the Taboola network, you will see cards for other services like the weather, videos, and marketing cards for in-app purchases, sponsored content and more — additions that have in part been made possible by some of Taboola’s recent acquisitions like ConvertMedia and Commerce Sciences.  The germination for adding a news feed comes from the fact that Taboola doesn’t feel like its set of links are a solution, as much as they are part of an ongoing problem.  “Today, when you look at publishers’ sites, it’s a shitshow,” Adam Singolda, Taboola’s founder and CEO, said in an interview. “You have the right rail, at the bottom you have Taboola, you have newsletter widgets, and commenting and navigation bars. And in mobile it’s even worse.” He said that Taboola’s tests have found that the average user reads one article and then just goes back to Facebook. “Engagement becomes horrible because the experience is really bad.”  In trying to figure out how to solve that problem, Taboola — which is based in New York but was founded in and still operates in Israel — has taken a page from the new guard of cybersecurity companies: the best way to combat a threat today is to put yourself (or your security system) in the mindset of that threat. “Even though I have a lot of issues with Facebook they are doing something well, the news feed,” he said. “Scrolling down you are presented with different cards — images or posts or links or videos or ads — but it’s a consistent, ongoing experience. Users don’t have to get to know Facebook all over again each time something new is introduced, and so they keep scrolling, for an hour or more a day.” The ideal, he said, is to get the 1 billion or so people who see and (potentially) click on Taboola links to spend more than 3 seconds on a page: to move them to three minutes, and perhaps one day to three hours. This is especially relevant in markets where mobile is the primary platform for media consumption and browsing. Singolda said that today in the U.S. and Western Europe, about half of the readers across its network are on mobile. In parts of Asia, that proportion is 90 percent. Taboola’s news feed is not completely replacing the Taboola grid at this point, but this is Singolda’s long-term intention. It’s one more way to bring in more engagement, but it is also another way for Taboola to differentiate from its lookalike competitors. These include the likes of Outbrain, which has long been the subject of speculation that it will merge with Taboola. Nothing to report on that front yet, Singolda said. Readers using the new feed will, for now, click out of a publisher’s page to go to a new page in the browser to read stories, with a small option to click back to the originating page. Singolda told me that the idea will be to introduce AMP pages into the mix over time to speed up the jumps, as Taboola is already an AMP partner. I’ll be looking to see how that plays out, since AMP links currently mean no traffic for the originating or endpoint publications, with Google hosting the speed-up pages on its own URLs. Same, too, goes for the idea of bringing in infinite scrolls, which seem to pose their own kinds of unique challenges for publishers that want to keep readers engaged on their own properties, not floating away on an endless river provided by someone else. Taboola has raised over $160 million, and Singolda said that it’s profitable and has $100 million of that funding still in the bank.  \n",

In this episode of Judah vs. the Machines, actor Judah Friedlander sets about his goal of “challenging the world’s top artificial intelligence robots for the sake of humanity” by taking a look at Facebook’s applied machine learning team. The actor, best known for his portrayal of Frank Rossitano on NBC’s much-loved 30 Rock, descends on the Menlo Park campus at 1 Hacker Way to get a little taste of what life is like working at one of the world’s biggest tech companies. After exhausting all of the campus’s free perks, Friedlander tests the wits of FB’s machine learning team. The AI he’s examining isn’t combating fake news or sensitive content on Facebook Live — it’s computer vision tech doing the all-important task of guessing dog breeds. To find out what the deal was with Facebook’s dog love, Friedlander had the chance to sit down with Joaquin Candela, who is the director of applied machine learning at Facebook. After discussing some of Facebook’s efforts in promoting their systems’ natural language recognition skills, Friedlander offered his own ideas for the future of communication before taking on the company’s dog-breed-fussing, AI which you can see in the video above. Facebook’s AI is appropriately not perfect, but does manage to best Friedlander. One of the breeds that befuddles both Judah and the FB AI is the Puli, which is the type of dog Mark Zuckerberg owns (Beast). There’s never really a clear explanation of why Facebook has been training its system to do this, but I guess the better question is why would you not want a “Shazam for dogs”?   \n",

            "Facebook  Live might be about bringing the entire community together around events, but sometimes you just want to know the reactions of your buddies. Facebook has already announced that its AR camera effects platform will be coming to Live, an announcement today brings a couple of other changes to the platform surrounding social interactions in Live: Live Chat with Friends and Live With. Comment streams on popular Live videos are a bit overwhelming at the moment, there’s a pretty torrential outpour of similar reactions to when something happens on video. Facebook says that there are actually ten times as many comments on Live vides as there are on regular recorded videos. Ultimately, Facebook wants to help you sift through the visual spam and have more meaningful interactions on these videos, which is why they’re adding a feature that lets you easily live chat with friends inside Live videos. When you create a private chatroom, you’ll have the option of inviting new people or just finding out who among your friends is already watching and toss them into a private room. It’s a way for Facebook to dial-in the wide-reaching Live platform and make it more personal for users. People can still easily jump in between group feeds and friend chat.  In addition to the Live Chat with Friends feature, Facebook is launching a feature that will let you go live with another friend in a side-by-side conversation. This feature was previously available to public figures, but now it’s rolling out wide, allowing you to argue or chat with friends in a Live setting. Live With basically allows you to FaceTime with your friends in a public setting, it’s a completely different way to capture social interaction and it definitely offers something new. You have these conversations in landscape mode for a split-screen style or portrait for picture-in-picture mode as seen in the image. Live With is open for all profiles and pages on iOS. Facebook is already testing Live Chat with Friends in a few countries and says they’ll be making it more widely available later this summer.  \n",

            "238 Facebook’s content moderation rules dubbed ‘alarming’ by child safety charity\n",
            "The Guardian has published details of Facebook’s content moderation guidelines covering controversial issues such as violence, hate speech and self-harm culled from more than 100 internal training manuals, spreadsheets and flowcharts that the newspaper has seen. The documents set out in black and white some of the contradictory positions Facebook  has adopted for dealing with different types of disturbing content as it tries to balance taking down content with holding its preferred line on “free speech.” This goes some way toward explaining why the company continues to run into moderation problems. That and the tiny number of people it employs to review and judge flagged content. The internal moderation guidelines show, for example, that Facebook allows the sharing of some photos of non-sexual child abuse, such as depictions of bullying, and will only remove or mark up content if there is deemed to be a sadistic or celebratory element. Facebook is also comfortable with imagery showing animal cruelty — with only content that is deemed “extremely upsetting” to be marked up as disturbing. And the platform apparently allows users to live stream attempts to self-harm — because it says it “doesn’t want to censor or punish people in distress.” When it comes to violent content, Facebook’s guidelines allow videos of violent deaths to be shared, while marked as disturbing, as it says they can help create awareness of issues. While certain types of generally violent written statements — such as those advocating violence against women, for example — are allowed to stand as Facebook’s guidelines require what it deems “credible calls for action” in order for violent statements to be removed. The policies also include guidelines for how to deal with revenge porn. For this type of content to be removed Facebook requires three conditions are fulfilled — including that the moderator can “confirm” a lack of consent via a “vengeful context” or from an independent source, such as a news report. According to a leaked internal document seen by The Guardian, Facebook had to assess close to 54,000 potential cases of revenge porn in a single month. Other details from the guidelines show that anyone with more than 100,000 followers is designated a public figure and so denied the protections afforded to private individuals; and that Facebook changed its policy on nudity following the outcry over its decision to remove an iconic Vietnam war photograph depicting a naked child screaming. It now allows for “newsworthy exceptions” under its “terror of war” guidelines. (Although images of child nudity in the context of the Holocaust are not allowed on the site.) The exposé of internal rules comes at a time when the social media giant is under mounting pressure for the decisions it makes on content moderation. In April, for example, the German government backed a proposal to levy fines of up to €50 million on social media platforms for failing to remove illegal hate speech promptly. A U.K. parliamentary committee has also this month called on the government to look at imposing fines for content moderation failures. While, earlier this month, an Austrian court ruled Facebook must remove posts deemed to be hate speech — and do so globally, rather than just blocking their visibility locally. At the same time, Facebook’s live streaming feature has been used to broadcast murders and suicides, with the company apparently unable to preemptively shut off streams. In the wake of the problems with Facebook Live, earlier this month the company said it would be hiring 3,000 extra moderators — bringing its total headcount for reviewing posts to 7,500. However this remains a drop in the ocean for a service that has close to two billion users who are sharing an aggregate of billions of pieces of content daily. Asked for a response to Facebook’s moderation guidelines, a spokesperson for the U.K.’s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children described the rules as “alarming” and called for independent regulation of the platform’s moderation policies — backed up with fines for non-compliance. “This insight into Facebook’s rules on moderating content is alarming to say the least,” the spokesperson told us. “There is much more Facebook can do to protect children on their site. Facebook, and other social media companies, need to be independently regulated and fined when they fail to keep children safe.” In its own statement responding to The Guardian’s  story, Facebook’s Monika Bickert, head of global policy management, said: “Keeping people on Facebook safe is the most important thing we do. We work hard to make Facebook as safe as possible while enabling free speech. This requires a lot of thought into detailed and often difficult questions, and getting it right is something we take very seriously. Mark Zuckerberg recently announced that over the next year, we’ll be adding 3,000 people to our community operations team around the world — on top of the 4,500 we have today — to review the millions of reports we get every week, and improve the process for doing it quickly.” She also said Facebook is investing in technology to improve its content review process, including looking at how it can do more to automate content review — although it’s currently mostly using automation to assist human content reviewers. “In addition to investing in more people, we’re also building better tools to keep our community safe,” she said. “We’re going to make it simpler to report problems to us, faster for our reviewers to determine which posts violate our standards and easier for them to contact law enforcement if someone needs help.” CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously talked about using AI to help parse and moderate content at scale — although he also warned such technology is likely years out. Facebook is clearly pinning its long-term hopes for the massive content moderation problem it is saddled with on future automation. However the notion that algorithms can intelligently judge such human complexities as when nudity may or may not be appropriate is very much an article of faith on the part of the technoutopianists. The harder political reality for Facebook is that pressure from the outcry over its current content moderation failures will force it to employ a lot more humans to clean up its act in the short term. Add to that, as these internal moderation guidelines show, Facebook’s own position in apparently wanting to balance openness/free expression with “safety” is inherently contradictory — and invites exactly the sorts of problems it’s running into with content moderation controversies. It would be relatively easy for Facebook to ban all imagery showing animal cruelty, for example — but such a position is apparently “too safe” for Facebook. Or rather too limiting of its ambition to be the global platform for sharing. And every video of a kicked dog is, after all, a piece of content for Facebook to monetize. Safe to say, living with that disturbing truth is only going to get more uncomfortable for Facebook. In its story, The Guardian quotes a content moderation expert, called Sarah T Roberts, who argues that Facebook’s content moderation problem is a result of the vast scale of its “community.” “It’s one thing when you’re a small online community with a group of people who share principles and values, but when you have a large percentage of the world’s population and say ‘share yourself,’ you are going to be in quite a muddle,” she said. “Then when you monetise that practice you are entering a disaster situation.” Update: Also responding to Facebook’s guidelines, Eve Critchley, head of digital at U.K. mental health charity Mind, said the organization is concerned the platform is not doing enough. “It is important that they recognize their responsibility in responding to high risk content. While it is positive that Facebook has implemented policies for moderators to escalate situations when they are concerned about someone’s safety, we remain concerned that they are not robust enough,” she told us. “Streaming people’s experience of self-harm or suicide is an extremely sensitive and complex issue,” she added. “We don’t yet know the long-term implications of sharing such material on social media platforms for the public and particularly for vulnerable people who may be struggling with their own mental health. What we do know is that there is lots of evidence showing that graphic depictions of such behavior in the media can be very harmful to viewers and potentially lead to imitative behavior. As such we feel that social media should not provide a platform to broadcast content of people hurting themselves. “Social media can be used in a positive way and can play a really useful role in a person’s wider support network, but it can also pose risks. We can’t assume that an individual’s community will have the knowledge or understanding necessary, or will be sympathetic in their response. We also fear that the impact on those watching would not only be upsetting but could also be harmful to their own mental health. “Facebook and other social media sites must urgently explore ways to make their online spaces safe and supportive. We would encourage anyone managing or moderating an online community to signpost users to sources of urgent help, such as Mind, Samaritans or 999 when appropriate.”  \n",

            "239 Facebook rolls out a new “Order Food” option in its main navigation\n",
            "Facebook  is now making it easier for you to order food from your favorite restaurants directly within its app, without having to navigate away to a delivery service or restaurant’s own app or website. In the main Facebook navigation on both web and mobile, a new option called “Order Food” is rolling out to select users. Indicated by a colorful hamburger icon on desktop and a blue-and-white hamburger icon on mobile, the option lets Facebook users place food pickup and delivery orders from restaurants using Delivery.com or Slice.  Above: “Order Food” on mobile  Above: “Order Food” on desktop  The entire process, from ordering to checkout, takes place on Facebook when you use this menu option. The feature is an expansion on a previously announced deal with online ordering businesses, Delivery.com and Slice, which Facebook detailed back in October. At that time, the company said that it would allow Facebook users to place orders with supported restaurants from their own Facebook Pages through a “Start Order” button.  The “Order Food” feature in the main navigation works similarly, but makes it more convenient as it aggregates all the supported restaurants together on one page. Here, you’ll find a list of restaurants, which include a featured photo, price range (indicated by dollar signs), star ratings, and type of cuisine. It will also display whether delivery, pickup or both are available. You can then click “Start Order” to begin the ordering process – much like you could before, if ordering directly from the restaurant’s Facebook Page. According to one user who successfully used the service last night on mobile to order a calzone, when you tap through to being your order, you’re able to browse the menu, add items to your cart, edit your order, add a suggested tip, then pay within Facebook, in a mobile experience powered by either Delivery.com or Slice. After payment, a confirmation screen appears letting you now that you’ll also receive an email to confirm your order and a time frame when the order is expected to arrive or be ready for pickup. Perhaps because the feature is still rolling out, its availability has been a little flaky to start. For example, the option itself has disappeared and reappeared for some; other times, it says there aren’t places that can deliver to you right now; and, in my own tests, the button “Order Food” showed up on my iPhone, but then didn’t load a page properly when tapping through. For Facebook users, the feature is one of convenience – they don’t have to leave Facebook to place orders, or visit individual Facebook Pages to see if online ordering is available. But for Facebook, it’s another example of how the network is aiming to duplicate the functionality of other apps installed on users’ devices, and rolling out other features that keep users inside its walls.  Over the past several months, Facebook has introduced a number of these sorts of features, including weather, a networking section called “discover people,” a travel section called “city guides,” government info via “town hall,” an online jobs board, fundraisers, instant games, and more. Reached for comment, Facebook confirmed that the “Order Food” functionality is related to the October news of Slice and Delivery.com food ordering functionality via restaurants’ Facebook Pages, but didn’t offer any details as to when the new button in Facebook’s navigation began appearing for U.S. users. We understand from sources familiar with product, however, that the functionality is the same as what was unveiled in October, but Facebook is now testing a new entry point for ordering food through its main navigation. Because this is a test, not all Facebook users may see the option at this time. (Image credits: @fbjag; @mattlynley)  \n",

            "240 Facebook takes on Twitch with new live-streaming deal for esports\n",
            "In addition to Facebook’s  announcement of a new partnership with the MLB to live stream a number of regular season games, the social network this week also signed a deal with global esports company ESL to bring over 5,550 hours of esports events and other original content to Facebook, including 1,500 of original programming. The move will aid Facebook in challenging Amazon-owned Twitch  as well as Twitter, both of which have esports deals as part of their efforts in the live streaming space. For example, Twitter in March announced its own partnerships with ESL and DreamHack to bring over 15 events from the ESL  One, Intel Extreme Masters and DreamHack circuits to Twitter, where they’ll be made available for live streaming on the web and mobile, directly through the Twitter app. Meanwhile, video game streaming site Twitch is still today the de facto home for esports content. Last June, a report indicated that over 100 million Twitch users had streamed 800 million hours of esports in the last ten months on the service, with event and league organizers gathering the lion’s share of those views – accounting for 71.3 percent of all esports viewership. Facebook’s deal will kick off next month, beginning with content from the Rank S competitions, a ladder for the Counter Strike:Global Offensive community. This will be supplemented by an exclusive, 30-minute CS:GO weekly show that will feature the top players, upcoming talent and other competition highlights. All the ESL One and Intel Extreme Masters will also stream via ESL’s Facebook network across six languages – English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish and German.  The company has made other more moves to attract live streamers to its network in recent days, as well. It added support for desktop streaming to user profiles, allowing gamers to more easily stream their gameplay, and it announced other content partnerships with esports teams Team Dignitas and Echo Fox. For esports companies like ESL, the opportunity to stream on Facebook means they’ll have a chance to reach a broader audience – including, perhaps, more mainstream viewers who don’t regularly frequent a video gaming-focused destination like Twitch. However, the deals don’t preclude ESL from also streaming to rival networks like Twitch, Twitter, or YouTube. “With over 1.94 billion monthly active users on Facebook, this is a huge step toward expanding the reach of esports among mainstream audiences,” said Johannes Schiefer, Vice President of Social Media and Editorial at ESL, in statement, reiterating this point. “Last year, ESL content generated over 2 billion impressions and reached over 200 million users on Facebook globally. Now, with the addition of live streaming for all major ESL events, as well as exclusive content around CS:GO and ESEA, we are excited to expand our reach to more audiences and build strong local communities of highly engaged esports fans,” he added. ESEA is ESL’s subscription-based platform for amateur, semi-professional and professional CS:GO players. Its Rank S competition brings together over 300 of the best North American and European ESEA players who compete for a $40,000 prize pool each month across the two regions. ESL likely also sees Facebook as a means of re-engaging esports viewers when they’re not actively seeking out gaming content, thanks to Facebook’s ability to alert users about new live streams through push notifications, and other alerts when they’re more passively browsing the network. Facebook, too, recently adjusted its video settings on mobile to autoplay videos with the sound on – a change that could increase viewership of live streamed, professionally produced video content like this, and open up the door for more advertising possibilities Esports is a rapidly growing business and source of revenue – in 2016, global revenue reached $493 million, and it’s expected to see a 41.3 percent increase this year. By 2020, it’s expected to reach $1.488 billion. The content will begin streaming in June 2017 on the ESEA Facebook Page and in its official Facebook group.   \n",

            "TechCrunch  is hosting its first startup competition in Sub-Saharan Africa. We’ve wanted to bring TechCrunch to Africa for a long time, and now thanks to our sponsor Facebook, we will bring the Startup Battlefield competition, to Nairobi on October 11 this year. We’re looking for Sub-Saharan Africa’s best innovators, makers and technical entrepreneurs to participate in TechCrunch Battlefield Africa 2017. Startups can apply to three categories: social good, productivity and utility, gaming and entertainment. TechCrunch will host the event in Nairobi in front of a live audience and top judges, and we will live stream the show on TechCrunch and Facebook so the rest of the world can tune in. The judges will choose a winner in each category and select an overall winner, “Sub-Saharan Africa’s Most Promising Startup,” whose founders will win $25,000 USD in no-equity cash plus an all-expense paid trip for two to San Francisco to compete in the Battlefield at TechCrunch’s flagship event, Disrupt SF 2018 (assuming the company still qualifies to compete at this time).  The timing for Battlefield Africa 2017 could not be better. Sub-Saharan Africa just produced its first unicorn, Jumia, exits are increasingly frequent, and global venture capitalists are taking note. Sub-Saharan African startups are helping unleash the region’s potential, from last-mile technologies that deliver edtech, agritech, and medtech to remote areas, to mobile-based fintech innovations that ease financial transactions and lending in bustling cities. Sub-Saharan Africa’s diversity in language, culture, politics, technology and living standards demands huge creativity from entrepreneurs. Sub-Saharan African startups, for example, have proven themselves particularly skilled at innovating with low-cost mobile applications, rather than capital-intensive, high-broadband web applications. That makes sense in a region where access to a mobile phone is often more likely than access to clean water or electricity. Innovations that can scale to fingertips globally are fueling human possibility and expansion to global markets. TechCrunch is eager to take part in covering Africa’s burgeoning tech sector more fully. We love to see startup ecosystems develop, and Battlefield is one of the best platforms in the world to spotlight the most promising ventures for investors, partners and even future employees. Our editors carefully pick the best startups to compete from hundreds of applications, and recruits world class judges to ask tough questions and pick the winners. And the Battlefield staff coaches the founders to make brilliant pitches on stage at the Battlefield event We will stream the whole event to viewers around the world thanks to TechCrunch’s enormous global reach. At the end of the day, that’s why the 648 companies that have competed in Battlefield have raised $6.9 billion and produced 95 exits to date. Here’s how to participate Startups must fit into one of three categories (social good, productivity and utility, gaming and entertainment) to participate. Five startups in each category will be selected to join us on stage for the Battlefield Africa in Nairobi.

            "242 Facebook and MLB partner to bring live-streamed games to the social network\n",
            "Facebook  and the MLB announced today a new live-streaming partnership that will bring 20 live, regular season games to the social network. The games will air weekly on Facebook, with the first — Rockies at Reds — showing tomorrow night at 7:10 PM ET on the official MLB Facebook Page. Additional games and times will be announced later. The weekly broadcasts on Facebook will come from a feed of a participating team’s local broadcaster rightsholder, the companies said. “It’s really important for us in terms of experimenting with a new partner in this area… we’re really excited about this new partnership,” noted Commissioner Rob Manfred when announcing the organization’s plans to live stream games on Friday nights, without blackouts. This is not the first time the MLB has leveraged Facebook for streaming its games, however. The organization has been fairly forward-thinking in this area in the past. For example, in 2011 — before the launch of Facebook Live — MLB aired some of its spring training games live on Facebook by embedding its MLB.tv player into its Facebook Page. Since the launch of Facebook Live, the MLB has used the platform to live stream news and analysis from around the league, as with its Facebook airing of “12:25 Live with Alexa,” where it also incorporates fan comments and questions into its programming. It has also live streamed special league ceremonies, behind-the-scenes footage with players and teams and other live shows. It also went live for last season’s World Series for pre-game and post-game press conferences and other events. The new streaming deal will expand beyond these earlier efforts to actually stream live games to Facebook users — broadening access to games beyond their local markets. However, the games will only live stream to users in the U.S., the MLB noted, not baseball fans worldwide. “Baseball games are uniquely engaging community experiences, as the chatter and rituals in the stands are often as meaningful to fans as the action on the diamond,” said Dan Reed, Facebook’s Head of Global Sports Partnerships, in a statement. “By distributing a live game per week on Facebook, Major League Baseball can re-imagine this social experience on a national scale.” Competition in the live-streaming space has been heating up in recent months, with Twitter earlier this month having announced a slate of new live shows, including those from the WNBA, BuzzFeed, Viacom and others; Google’s launch of mobile live streaming on YouTube; Amazon-owned Twitch’s expansions beyond its traditional gaming content; and Amazon’s deal to stream NFL games. For Facebook, news of the MLB partnership comes following other, similar efforts to bring premium live-streamed sports to its social network. For example, the company in March announced a deal to stream Major League Soccer matches.  \n",

            "243 Facebook fined $122M in Europe over misleading WhatsApp filing\n",
            "Facebook’s  2014 acquisition of messaging app WhatsApp cost $19 billion when it was announced. Now the price tag has been bumped up a little more after European regulators slapped the company with a €110M (~$122M) fine for providing “incorrect or misleading” information at the time of the deal. The European Commission said today that Facebook told it at that time that it could not automatically match user accounts between its own platform and WhatsApp — yet the company subsequently revealed it would be doing just that. The controversial change to WhatsApp’s  privacy policy to share user data, including phone numbers, with Facebook took place in August last year — and led to widespread condemnation of the privacy U-turn. In a statement today, the European Commission said: “The Commission has found that, contrary to Facebook’s statements in the 2014 merger review process, the technical possibility of automatically matching Facebook and WhatsApp users’ identities already existed in 2014, and that Facebook staff were aware of such a possibility.” This follows a Statement of Objections to Facebook detailing the commission’s concerns last December. Facebook responded to the fine with its own statement — claiming it had made “errors” in 2014 when it made the filing to regulators. “We’ve acted in good faith since our very first interactions with the Commission and we’ve sought to provide accurate information at every turn. The errors we made in our 2014 filings were not intentional and the Commission has confirmed that they did not impact the outcome of the merger review. Today’s announcement brings this matter to a close,” it said. The EC is not reversing its decision to clear the WhatsApp acquisition. However, it’s clear the region’s regulators are waking up to the cumulative power of big data holdings. And European data protection agencies’ fast-flowing objections to the WhatsApp-Facebook data sharing quickly led to Facebook suspending these data flows in the region. In a statement on today’s fine, EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: “Today’s decision sends a clear signal to companies that they must comply with all aspects of EU merger rules, including the obligation to provide correct information. And it imposes a proportionate and deterrent fine on Facebook,” she added. The EC further notes that today’s decision is “unrelated to either ongoing national antitrust procedures or privacy, data protection or consumer protection issues, which may arise following the August 2016 update of WhatsApp terms of service and privacy policy.” So while Facebook is claiming the specific matter is closed, it remains to be seen whether the company will face further regulatory problems related to its ownership and operation of WhatsApp. In the meantime, the company has confirmed to us that data sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook remains suspended in Europe.  \n",

            "Facebook  Messenger is getting a new look. No, it’s not getting rid of its Stories feature, Messenger  Day, but is instead making a series a smaller changes to the way the content on its home screen is organized in an effort to speed navigation and help you pick up where you left off on your last visit. The update introduces new tabs to the top of Messenger’s main screen for moving between your messages, active contacts, and groups. In addition, the app will now push you to visit other areas by using a red dot on various sections and tabs to let you know when there’s activity. Facebook explains that the new design is meant to better highlight the many other ways that people connect and communicate, beyond text messages. The update relocates Groups from the bottom navigation bar to the a tab at the top of the screen, making it a less prominent feature in the redesigned app. Now, at the top of the Messenger home screen, there are tabs for your messages and a list of who’s active on the app now (as indicated by the green dot next to their name), alongside the new groups tab.  Above: iOS inbox before By giving active users their own dedicated section, it feels like Messenger is encouraging you to start more conversations through the app, as it’s easier to see who’s online in one long, vertically scrollable list, as opposed the horizontal scrollbar before. But also, by centralizing all these messaging-focused areas into the home screen instead of spread around the app, it frees up Messenger to focus other, newer parts to its experience in its main navigation bar at the bottom. For example, Games – which just rolled out worldwide earlier this month – gets its own button on this bar now that Groups has been relocated elsewhere.  Above: iOS inbox after Oddly, given its desire to compete with Snapchat across platforms, Facebook has now decreased the size of its Camera button in Messenger. Before, the oversized button was larger than those surrounding it, often even leading to accidental presses – as well as a chance for Facebook to show off its Snapchat-like collection of filters, effects, and masks. With the update, however, the button is back to a normal size, and is nicely lined up with its neighbors. This is a better design aesthetic to be sure, but it also makes the Camera functionality feel less like Messenger’s leading feature, like the larger button did before. The updated bottom bar now has tabs for Home, Calls, the Camera button, People and Games. On iOS, there are labeled, too, where before they were just the icons. (On Android, the app is sticking with only the icons.) Above: Android Before & After Another new feature in the revamped Messenger app is the red dot that appears when one of the sections in the app has new activity. For example, if you haven’t read one of your messages, you’ll see the dot next to the Home icon on the bottom. If you missed a call, the red dot will appear next to the Calls tab on the top of your home screen. This will be a useful guide to helping you find those things you missed since you last logged on, but it could also be potentially annoying to those of us with app OCD. That is, if you’re one of those people who today taps the Marketplace button in Facebook just to clear the red dot from your screen, prepare to start clicking around Messenger more following the update. Facebook says the changes are rolling out to Messenger worldwide on both iOS and Android starting this week.  \n",

            "245 Facebook feed change fights clickbait post by post in 9 more languages\n",
            "Facebook’s leverage over news publishers can be worrisome, but today it’s putting its muscle to good use. The social network is bringing its battle against clickbait abroad, getting more precise about which link headlines it downranks in News Feed, and starting to demote individual posts instead of just web domains and Facebook Pages.  The updates are part of a News Feed algorithm change Facebookis rolling out today that builds on a push it started in 2014 and deepened last year in English against headlines that withhold or exaggerate information.  The changes could reduce News Feed reach and referral traffic to clickbait publishers, ranging from “You’ll never believe…” viral crap blogs to purposeful scammers and spammers. It could also help Facebook decrease the prevalence of “false news” that has become a major concern since Trump’s election.  Regarding the impact on publishers, Facebook  wrote: “Publishers that rely on clickbait headlines should expect their distribution to decrease. Pages should avoid headlines that withhold information required to understand the content of the article and headlines that exaggerate the article to create misleading expectations. If a Page stops posting clickbait and sensational headlines, their posts will stop being impacted by this change.” Now Facebook can detect and downrank clickbait headlines in German, Arabic, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese as well as English. Facebook News Feed product manager Greg Marra tells me Facebook selected these languages because they’re “commonly spoken ones that many people use in the world, We wanted to pick languages that would help many people, and where clickbait was a particular problem.” Facebook will start levying News Feed visibility decreases against individual posts that it qualifies as clickbait, rather than just counting violations against the overall reach of a Facebook Page or links to a certain domain.  Example of clickbait Facebook would classify as withholding information and demote in the News Feed Finally, Facebook is splitting its previous artificial intelligence clickbait classifier into two parts: one that looks for headlines that exaggerate their article’s content, and one that withholds this information. To build these, Facebook first had a team of humans analyze hundreds of thousands of posts in 10 total languages and identify which words and phrases were used most in clickbait headlines. It then used this dataset to train the two AI classifiers, which can now autonomously scan the millions of links shared to Facebook each day and demote the clickbaity ones in the News Feed. One concern is that satire and headlines that parody well-worn clickbait cliches might get caught up in this trawl. When asked about this, Marra said that “People prefer headlines that are written in a more straightforward fashion”, signalling that jokes that dope people into clicking might get dinged. Facebook has been aggressively rolling out algorithm changes to the News Feed in the last few months, likely hoping to shirk the image that it’s an enabler of false news. It’s made it easier to report misleading or false content, demoted fake and sensational posts, and reduced referral traffic to crappy ad-filled sites. It’s also published its report on state-sponsored disinformation and how its fighting it, put false news-spotting tips atop the News Feed and in newspapers, begun working with outside fact checkers to add warning labels to suspicious posts, and hired former New York Times VP of Product Alex Hardiman to run Facebook’s news products. Today’s update is important because when people get burned by clickbait headlines on Facebook, they may become less likely to visit the News Feed or click the links they see there. That could decrease both the ad clicks and legitimate referral traffic that give Facebook its power. In this way, Facebook’s ubiquity, scale, and influence may allow it to single-handedly help cleanse the Internet of one of its most prevalent scourges. While that centralized authority can allow it to squash startups, upend journalistic business models, and sway privacy norms in unsettling ways, at least here it could have a positive impact.  \n",

            "Facebook has partnered with The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention hotline for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or queer youth, to bring additional crisis support to Facebook Messenger. Back in March, Facebook brought suicide prevention tools to both Live and Messenger in partnership with organizations like the Crisis Text Line, the National Eating Disorder Association and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Facebook’s  lineup of partners, which now includes The Trevor Project, enables people contemplating suicide and/or feeling depressed to immediately, directly connect with them. Chat functionality with The Trevor Project will roll out over the next few months. Worldwide, there is a suicide attempt every 40 seconds, according to the World Health Organization.

            "The government of Thailand has backed down on a threat to ban Facebook  if it did not block content deemed to be illegal in the country. The ruling military junta last week said it would ban the U.S. social network if it did not disable Thailand-based users from being able to access a selection of 131 “illicit” posts, including content that violates lese majeste laws that prevent criticism of the royal family. The government set a deadline of 10:00 am on May 16 for the pages to be blocked, but TechCrunch has verified that the social network remains accessible in the country while Facebook has not censored the pages, according to media reports. Facebook provided the following statement: “When governments believe that something on the Internet violates their laws, they may contact companies like Facebook and ask us to restrict access to that content. When we receive such a request, it is scrutinized to determine if the specified content does indeed violate local laws. If we determine that it does, then we make it unavailable in the relevant country or territory and notify people who try to access it why it is restricted.” A Thai court initially drew up a list of 309 web pages to be censored. A government spokesperson told the Bangkok Post that Facebook had removed 178 of them as of last week. Facebook isn’t alone in being pushed to censor its pages. Google and YouTube deleted at least 469 web pages in response to recent government requests, according a report from The Nation. Google did not reply to a request for confirmation or comment. While Thailand hasn’t enforced a ban on Facebook at this time, it did temporarily block the social network in May 2014, one week after the military seized control of the country via a coup. Speaking at the time, it claimed the issue was down to a glitch, however mobile operator DTAC later revealed that it had acted on an order to block the social network. Facebook opened an office in Thailand in September 2015, and its audience measure tools suggest it has up to 45 million monthly users. That makes it the largest social network in the country by some margin. Rather than risk a public backlash from a full-out block, Thailand has instead pursued a policy of censoring specific pieces of content within the social network. This year, it has geo-blocked articles that fall within the lese majeste law and it even making it illegal to exchange information with three prominent critics of the regime who are based overseas. Facebook’s own data shows that the firm restricted access to 50 pieces of content in Thailand during 2016. In its most recent annual report, Freedom House, a U.S.-based think tank that monitors global web freedom, noted that Thailand’s internet and media are “not free.” The organization cited the jailing of citizens for interacting with Facebook posts and plans for a single national internet gateway to facilitate censorship among its key concerns.  \n",

            "To most of us, communication is a single task. But in reality, it’s not and if you’re a machine trying to replicate dialog, you need to be good at lots of tasks like answering questions, completing sentences and even having small talk. It’s common for research in each of these areas to be done independently, to the detriment of anyone trying to put the pieces together to create a conversational AI. The Facebook AI Research (FAIR) lab’s open source ParlAI serves as a home for dialog research, addressing this deficiency by making it easy to train models to complete multiple tasks with an assortment of commonly used datasets. Pulling a dataset into a workflow with ParlAI is as easy as throwing down some command line. This gives researchers quick access to benchmarking datasets like SQuAD, bAbI tasks and WebQuestions. This isn’t to say that the AI research community was unable to do this work before, but FAIR is trying to incentivize teams to regularly bring more datasets into their work. ParlAI also connects to Amazon Mechanical Turk so researchers can collect new data seamlessly. The New York-based FAIR team behind ParlAI. Jason Weston, a researcher at Facebook’s AI Research (FAIR) lab, told me in an interview that some of the inspiration for ParlAI came from watching researchers make progress on the WebQuestions dataset only to see the work largely ignored when it became clear that it was overly specialized and not applicable to other tasks. One of the challenges of following AI research is that it’s really hard to read papers at their face value. In nearly every paper, researchers claim to have achieved a new state of the art after benchmarking their fancy model against commonly used tests. The problem is that there are so many factors that can lead to a given outcome that achievements really only have value if they can be reproduced. ParlAI takes some of the work out of reproducing research to instill healthier habits for the AI community. The FAIR team hopes to add in its own leaderboard in the future to help make sense of progress in the ecosystem. ParlAI is similar in form to other training and testing solutions like OpenAI’s Gym and DeepMind’s Lab. But while Gym and Lab are optimized for reinforcement learning, ParlAI is focused squarely on dialog. Some of the supervised learning that underpins work in the dialog space is less sexy than trendy reinforcement learning, but it’s incredibly fundamental to the field of machine learning. FAIR plans to use its own ParlAI internally for research. Facebook’s work in dialog underpins many of its services, the most obvious one being “M,” its human + AI-powered assistant. Eventually, Weston tells me that a service like M might be able to learn from talking to people and receiving feedback, much like how babies and young children learn. But the only way to get there is to break artificial silos and combine research to solve large scale problems. You can find ParlAI on GitHub — the FAIR team will be maintaining it into the foreseeable future.  \n",

            "Facebook is making good on Mark Zuckerberg’s promise to build community by improving admin tools for Facebook Groups. Now Group admins can establish up to three questions for people requesting to join their Group to answer. This lets admins screen potential members to ensure they’re the right fit for the group and will add constructively to the discussion, not just spam or troll the Group. Facebook says this feature is now rolled out to 100% of group admins globally. A Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch: “Screening new membership requests requires time and legwork for admins – particularly for groups built around focused passions or purpose. For these groups, admins typically have specific criteria they require before admitting new members. Establishing these open-ended questions enables them to more quickly review and approve member requests; in turn, people seeking communities of support or shared interest can more quickly connect with others.”  Group Admins can find the “Ask Pending Members Questions” option in their Group’s settings menu. They then have the option to great up to 3 questions that potential members can answer in up to 250 characters each. Only admins and moderators see the answers to the questions, which are not posted to the group. Users who hit “Join” on a Group with a questionnaire will be asked to fill it out immediately, while those invited to join will get a notification linked to the form. Applicants can edit their answers until they’re reviewed. Previously if an admin wanted to inquire about why someone wanted to join their group, they’d have to either friend them, or try to send a Facebook Message that would likely be buried in their Message Requests. Doing this on a one-by-one basis and keeping track of the answers was likely too much effort for most admins. That led them to either indiscriminately admit people who might abuse the Group, or deny people based on limited information from the profile — excluding them from the Group’s community and support.  Back in February, Zuckerberg wrote that “One of the things that we’ve seen in online communities, but also including offline communities, is that having an engaged and talented leader is one of the key things for making a strong community … but right now our Groups product hasn’t really been built to facilitate the leaders.” Allowing Group leaders to define these questions and select who to admit based on the answers gives them much more control. It could lead to more productive discussion and less of the kind of disruption and needless posts that can cause members to turn off the notifications for a Group. Next month, Facebook will hold its first Communities Summit for Group admins in Chicago. There we might expect more product announcements based on the goals outlined in Zuckerberg’s manifesto. Those could include the ability to create sub-Groups, set more specific roles and permissions for moderators, and collect analytics about the performance of different content or Group growth.  \n",

            "You may have noticed the purple flower reaction has returned to Facebook,  allowing you to respond to posts with a “thankful” sentiment instead of a Like. As it turns out, the addition is only one of several features Facebook has planned for this Mother’s Day weekend here in the U.S., and throughout the month where the day is celebrated elsewhere in the world. The purple flower was introduced last year around Mother’s Day – only a few months after Facebook expanded the Like button to include a further range of reactions, such as love, haha, wow, sad, and angry. Initially only tested in a few markets before a wider rollout, the flower was also the first time the social network tried out the idea of using temporary reaction like this. This year, the flower reaction is again being made broadly available and it will have a special effect. On mobile, when you tap on “thankful” when reacting to a post, more flowers will appear to wrap themselves around the post in an animated sequence. In addition to the reaction, Facebook is adding Mother’s Day-themed masks and frames to its Facebook Camera, available when you swipe right on the News Feed. These will be live on Mother’s Day, Sunday May 14th. Instagram users, however, can decorate their photos now with a new set of Mother’s Day stickers, which work through direct messaging (Instagram Direct) and Instagram’s Stories.  Also on Sunday, Facebook’s News Feed will remind you that it’s Mother’s Day, and offer you the option to send a digital greeting card through the network. Facebook had first introduced a program in December that places these sorts of informational greetings at the top of the News Feed, alerting you to holidays and other historical or cultural events. The program kicked off with a set of holiday cards aimed at those who celebrated Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or just the winter season in general. Facebook said users should expect to see the option to send cards for other holidays in the future, too, and made good on that promise with Valentine’s cards in February. The new Mother’s Day cards will also go live on Sunday, and some can be personalized with your own photos. Finally, Facebook is allowing users in the U.S. to start fundraisers to donate to favorite causes in honor of your mom. You can raise funds for nonprofits, friends, or anyone or anything else that’s not on Facebook. This last one is live now.  \n",

            "251 Facebook downranks News Feed links to crappy sites smothered in ads\n",
            "Facebook  will bury links to low-quality websites and refuse to carry ads pointing to them in a News Feed algorithm change announced today. Facebook defines a “low-quality site” as one “containing little substantive content, and that is covered in disruptive, shocking or malicious ads.” This includes hosting pop-up and interstitial ads, adult ads or eye-catching but disgusting ads for products that fight fat or foot fungus. The change could help Facebook fight fake news, as fakers are often financially motivated and blanket their false information articles in ads. High-quality sites may see a slight boost in referral traffic, while crummy sites will see a decline as the update rolls out gradually over the coming months. Facebook tells me that the change will see it refuse an immaterial number of ad impressions that earned it negligible amounts of money, so it shouldn’t have a significant impact on Facebook’s revenue. Facebook product manager for News Feed Greg Marra tells me Facebook made the decision based on surveys of users about what disturbed their News Feed experience. One pain point they commonly cited was links that push them to “misleading, sensational, spammy, or otherwise low-quality experiences . . .[including] sexual content, shocking content, and other things that are going to be really disruptive.” Today’s change is important because if users don’t trust the content on the other side of the links and ads they see in News Feed, they’ll click them less. That could reduce Facebook’s advertising revenue and the power it derives from controlling referral traffic. Getting sent to a low-quality, shocking site from News Feed could also frustrate users and cause them to end their Facebook browsing session, depriving the social network of further ad views, engagement and content sharing. Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Facebook previously tried to reduce the prevalence of links to low-quality sites with a 2014 News Feed update that suppressed sites that people came back to News Feed immediately after viewing. To implement the update, Marra tells me Facebook “reviewed hundreds of thousands of webpages, identifying which ones have low-quality content.” It used this data to train an AI system to constantly scan new links shared in News Feed, looking for ones that match the low-quality site training data set. It then demotes these sites and blocks them from buying Facebook ads. The parameters Facebook used to classify sites as low-quality include: A disproportionate volume of ads relative to content. This includes advertisements, and not legal obligations such as cookie policies or logins to private content, such as paywalls. Featuring sexually suggestive or shocking content. See relevant policies for Sensational Content and Adult Content. Pages that contain malicious or deceptive ads which include Prohibited Content as defined in our policies. Use of pop-up ads or interstitial ads, which disrupt the user experience. One of the most prominent hosts of these types of ads is Forbes, which shows an annoying full-screen interstitial ad before you can read its articles. When specifically asked if Forbes would come under the gun, Marra diplomatically admitted “Interstitial popover ads are one of things people are telling us are disruptive. If Facebook can keep people confident that the links they click lead to quality content, it could continue to be the homepage of the internet.  \n",

            "252 Facebook posts its fast and accurate ConvNet models for machine translation on GitHub\n",
            "In its latest paper, the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) team dropped some impressive results for its implementation of a modified convolutional neural network for machine translation. Facebook says it has achieved a small bump in accuracy at nine times the speed of traditional recurrent network models. And to complement its research, the company is releasing its pre-trained models on GitHub, along with all the tools needed to replicate the results on your own. When most of us think of machine translation, we think of Google Translate (sorry Facebook  and my 8th grade Spanish teacher). But while that is certainly the most well-known implementation, Facebook relies on the technology extensively for translating posts on News Feed, among other uses. In these use cases, accuracy is important to a deliver competitive experience, but arguably speed is even more important to Facebook. With nearly two billion users, every incremental improvement in speed is magnified. And Facebook isn’t just promising an incremental improvement, they’re promising an improvement of 900 percent.  In terms of accuracy, the gold standard for evaluating the quality of machine translation is BLEU, bilingual evaluation understudy. Facebook benchmarked its sequence to sequence convolutional approach on three tasks — translating English to Romanian, translating English to German and translating English to French. David Grangier and Michael Auli, two of the authors on the paper, explained to me that these tasks weren’t selected because they are the hardest languages to translate, but because they are the most competitive and others have already achieved impressive BLEU scores using alternative methods. Based on these numbers, applying ConvNets to machine translation is a worthy pursuit, but it’s worth stepping back a bit to explore why recurrent nets are typically used over ConvNets for translation in the first place. Recurrent networks take into account time series information, which makes them ideal for handling sequential tasks — reading left to right is a great example of this. ConvNets, on the other hand, have risen in prominence in recent years because of how useful they are for analyzing visual information. They process information simultaneously rather than sequentially, which presents barriers if you want to use them for machine translation. To make it work, Facebook implemented what it calls “multi-hop attention.”  Machine translation is a two-step process. As humans, we take for granted the process of understanding a sentence in our own language, but machines have to first put resources into this before they can output to another language. Another thing we don’t realize is that everything we do is governed by probabilities. “Bait” for example can be both a noun and a verb, and when we evaluate a sentence we are subconsciously assigning likelihoods that help us interpret meaning. This requires us to reference other parts of a sentence at different times to develop understanding. In something of a twist on this process, Facebook’s multi-hop takes advantage of the simultaneous nature of ConvNets to allow machines to reference different parts of text to build understanding during encoding. Once this is done and a vector representation is created, a translation can be outputted one word at a time until it’s complete. Grangier and Auli believe their models can be engineered to do more than simply machine translation. Their ConvNet could be used in any scenario where a computer needs to understand text and express something, so this could include summarizing text or even interpreting a reading and then asking questions. Both reinforcement learning and adversarial networks have the potential to improve upon the results achieved by Facebook — each of these could become a standalone paper. Additionally, the team hopes to further experiment with the applications of multi-hop attention.  \n",

            "More bad news for Facebook  on the content front: An Austrian court has ruled the company must remove posts deemed to be hate speech, Reuters reports. The case was brought last year by Austria’s Green party over what it argued were defamatory insults to its leader, Eva Glawischnig, posted to Facebook by a fake account. The party said the posts were not taken down — despite repeated complaints. And the Commercial Court of Vienna granted a preliminary injunction in December, ruling that Facebook must take down posts deemed to be hateful under Austrian law. Facebook’s appeal against that ruling now looks to have failed — with the appeals court strengthening the original ruling by saying it must removal both the original post and any verbatim repostings. The court has also ruled that Facebook must remove content globally rather than just blocking posts locally — expanding the significance of the ruling beyond Austria’s borders. The Austrian court did not go so far as to suggest Facebook is responsible for weeding out similar hate speech postings. But Reuters reports that the Green party intends to push for that by taking the case to the country’s highest court. The party is also hoping to force Facebook to identify the holders of fake accounts, and to pay damages for hate speech being spread on its platform, arguing that the ability to win damages would make it easier for individuals to pursue legal action against the company, given the costs involved. At the time of writing Facebook had not responded to a request for comment. We’ll update this post with any statement. Facebook has been facing increasing pressure about its response to hate speech complaints in Europe. Last month politicians in Germany voted to back proposals for a law to hit social media firms with fines of up to €50 million if they fail to promptly remove illegal hate speech from their platforms — within 24 hours after a complaint has been made for “obviously criminal content”, and within seven days for other illegal content. This month UK MPs also called for the government to consider a similar approach there, to try to enforce better standards of content moderation on social platform giants — with signs some US lawmakers might be thinking along similar lines too, vis-a-vis terrorism content. In the UK in recent times Facebook has faced accusations it has ignored complaints about extremist content and child abuse imagery being shared on its platform — and that it only removed the content when contacted by the media outlets reporting on the problem, suggesting its content moderation systems are struggling to handle the volume of complaints. Last week Facebook itself announced it would be increasing the headcount of the team it employs to review flagged content — saying 3,000 more staff would be added to the existing 4,500 people it already has working on this. Although for a platform that has close to two billion users a few thousand extra moderators really are a drop in the ocean of content it is generating. Differences in local laws around hate speech also obviously complicate this process for a US company operating a global platform. And it’s not clear where exactly its new moderators will be based — although Facebook has previously said it employs moderators in Germany and Dublin to review European content. In recent weeks, some extremely disturbing incidents being broadcast on Facebook Live, its live video streaming platform, have also served to raise the profile and awareness of the risks of moderation failures. Meanwhile, the perception that fake news is being liberally spread via Facebook continues to pile political pressure on the company. On this front it emerged today that Facebook has taken some pre-emptive steps to try to defang criticism of misinformation being spread via its platform ahead of the UK General Election next month — announcing it’s purged “tens of thousands” of fake accounts. It has also taken out adverts in British newspapers to warn people to be more skeptical of things they read, as it did in France ahead of presidential elections there. But despite taking some steps to tweak its News Feed to combat deliberate attempts to game the algorithm, the company has faced criticism that its response has been inadequate — and that it continues to profit from fake news — even as concerns that the power of its platform has been misappropriated by malicious actors intent on trying to subvert the democratic process persist. And with lawmakers in various countries taking increasing notice of how various types of socially divisive content can be seen being amplified on Facebook’s platform it looks unlikely there will be any near term let up in pressure on the company. Having a CEO who pens open letters apparently setting out Facebook’s ‘humanitarian manifesto‘ does not appear to have done much to help the company’s reputation as a misinformation muck spreader. tl;dr: Zuckerberg better buckle up for a bumpy ride.  \n",

            "255 Facebook culls ‘tens of thousands’ of fake accounts ahead of UK election\n",
            "Facebook  has revealed that it has purged “tens of thousands” of fake accounts in the U.K. ahead of a general election next month. The BBC reported this non-specific figure earlier today, with Facebook also saying it is monitoring the repeated posting of the same content or a sharp increase in messaging and flagging accounts displaying such activity. Providing more detail on these measures, Facebook told us: “These changes help us detect fake accounts on our service more effectively — including ones that are hard to spot. We’ve made improvements to recognize these inauthentic accounts more easily by identifying patterns of activity — without assessing the content itself. For example, our systems may detect repeated posting of the same content, or an increase in messages sent. With these changes, we expect we will also reduce the spread of material generated through inauthentic activity, including spam, misinformation, or other deceptive content that is often shared by creators of fake accounts.” Facebook has previously been accused of liberal bias by demoting conservative views in its Trending Topics feature — which likely explains why it’s so keen to specify that systems it’s built to try to suppress the spread of certain types of “inauthentic” content do not assess “the content itself.” Another fake news-related tweak Facebook says it has brought to the U.K. to try to combat the spread of misinformation is to take note of whether people share an article they’ve read — with its rational being that if a lot of people don’t share something they’ve read it might be because the information is misleading. “We’re always looking to improve News Feed by listening to what the community is telling us. We’ve found that if reading an article makes people significantly less likely to share it, that may be a sign that a story has misled people in some way. In December, we started to test incorporating this signal into ranking, specifically for articles that are outliers, where people who read the article are significantly less likely to share it. We’re now expanding the test to the UK,” Facebook said on this. The company has also taken out adverts in U.K. national newspapers displaying tips to help people spot fake news — having taken similar steps in France last month prior to its presidential election. In a statement about its approach to tackling fake news in the U.K., Facebook’s director of policy for the country, Simon Milner, claimed the company is “doing everything we can.” “People want to see accurate information on Facebook and so do we. That is why we are doing everything we can to tackle the problem of false news,” he said. “We have developed new ways to identify and remove fake accounts that might be spreading false news so that we get to the root of the problem. To help people spot false news we are showing tips to everyone on Facebook on how to identify if something they see is false. We can’t solve this problem alone so we are supporting third party fact checkers during the election in their work with news organisations, so they can independently assess facts and stories.” A spokesperson told us that Facebook’s “how to spot” fake news ads (pictured below) are running in U.K. publications, including The Times, The Telegraph, Metro and The Guardian. Tips the company is promoting include being skeptical of headlines; checking URLs to view the source of the information; asking whether photos look like they have been manipulated; and cross-referencing with other news sources to try to verify whether a report has multiple sources publishing it.    Facebook does not appear to be running these ads in U.K. newspapers with the largest readerships, such as The Sun and The Daily Mail, which suggests the exercise is mostly a PR drive by the company to try to be seen to be taking some very public steps to fight the fake news political hot potato. The political temperature on this issue is not letting up for Facebook. Last month, for example, a U.K. parliamentary committee said the company must do more to combat fake news — criticizing it for not responding fast enough to complaints. “They can spot quite quickly when something goes viral. They should then be able to check whether that story is true or not and, if it is fake, blocking it or alerting people to the fact that it is disputed. It can’t just be users referring the validity of the story. They have to make a judgment about whether a story is fake or not,” argued select committee chairman Damian Collins. Facebook has also been under growing pressure in the U.K. for not swiftly handling complaints about the spread of hate speech, extremist and illegal content on its platform — and earlier this month another parliamentary committee urged the government to consider imposing fines on it and other major social platforms for content moderation failures in a bid to impose better moderation standards. Add to that Facebook’s specific role in influencing the elections, which again will be facing scrutiny later today when the BBC’s Panorama program screens an investigation of how content spread via Facebook during the U.S. election and the U.K.’s Brexit referendum — including considering how much money the social networking giant makes from fake news. The BBC is already teasing this spectacularly awkward clip of Milner being interviewed for the program, where he is repeatedly asked how much money the company makes from fake news — and repeatedly fails to provide a specific answer. Facebook declined to respond on this when we asked for comment on the program’s claims. Safe to say, there are some very awkward questions for Facebook here (as there has been for Google too, recently, relating to ads being served alongside extremist content on YouTube). And while Milner says the company aspires to reduce “to zero” the money it makes from fake news, it’s clearly not yet in a position to say it does not financially benefit from the spread of misinformation. And while it’s also true that some traditional media outlets have or can benefit from spreading falsity — earlier this year, for example, The Daily Mail was itself effectively branded a source of fake news by Wikipedia editors who voted to exclude it as a source for the website on the grounds that the information it contains is “generally unreliable” — the issue with Facebook goes beyond having an individually skewed editorial agenda. It’s about a massively scalable distribution technology whose core philosophy is to operate without any preemptive editorial checks and balances at all. The point is, Facebook’s staggering size, combined with the algorithmic hierarchy of its News Feed, which can create feedback loops of popularity, means its product can act as an amplification platform for fake news. And for all The Daily Mail’s evident divisiveness, it does not control a global distribution platform that’s pushing close to two billion active users. So, really, it’s Facebook’s unprecedented reach and power that is the core of the issue here when you’re considering whether technology might be undermining democracy. No other media outlet has ever come close to such scale. And that’s why this issue is intrinsically bound up with Facebook — because it foregrounds the vast power the platform wields, and the commensurate lack of regulation in how it applies that power. Ads in national newspapers are therefore really best viewed as Facebook trying to influence politicians, as lawmakers wake up to the power of Facebook. So maybe there should be an eleventh tip in Facebook’s false news advert: Consider the underlying agenda. In the U.K., Facebook says that it is working with local third-party fact-checking organization Full Fact, and with the Google News Lab-backed First Draft organization, to work with “major newsrooms to address rumors and misinformation spreading online during the UK general election” — echoing the approach it announced in Germany in January, ahead of German elections this September… although the effectiveness of that approach has already been questioned. Facebook says full details of the U.K. initiative will be announced “in due course.” The U.K.’s surprise General Election — called by Prime Minister Theresa May late last month, despite her previously stated intent not to call an election before 2020 — presumably caught the company on the hop. With just one month to go until polling day in the U.K. it remains to be seen whether May’s election U-turn also caught the fake political news spreaders on the hop.  \n",

            "256 Facebook debuts a Twitter-like ‘Latest Conversations’ feature that shows public posts about buzzing topics\n",
            "Facebook  is rolling out a new feature called “Latest Conversations” in its search results that will show the most recent public posts about timely topics that a lot of people across its network are discussing. The unit gives you a wider view of what people are saying about a news story or other subject by exposing you to sentiments being expressed outside your social circle. The ability to see public posts is not necessarily a new thing for Facebook, but this “Latest Conversations” unit is different from what was available previously. Before, when performing a broad keyword-based search on Facebook, the main search results page would display a mix of news articles, photos, videos, public posts, pages, groups and apps (if applicable) associated with the search term. “Latest Conversations,” however, appears as its own section within the search results and includes a running — and live-updating! — counter showing how many people are talking about the topic right now.  This counter gives you an idea of how widely discussed the topic is on the Facebook network. It’s common to see a subject that more than a million users are actively posting about, for example. The feature is not exactly an ideal means of understanding the news, or getting a sense of how most users feel about a topic. Often, the posts returned in “Latest Conversations” won’t only be in your native language, and will be from users around the world. (Offering a “translate” button here could go a long way.)  The addition comes at a time when Facebook is trying to pop users’ “filter bubbles” — meaning expose you to views outside of your self-selected network of friends, who often share the same values and mindset as you. Facebook’s algorithms have become smart enough to know which topics a user wants to see and will engage with, leading the company to optimize a user’s News Feed for those types of posts. But this also means you’re no longer seeing what the opposing side may believe, and that has led to disastrous results. The company was criticized about the echo chamber it creates following the U.S. presidential election, as it became apparent that users are only shown media and news that reinforced their existing views, rather than informed them. “Latest Conversations” doesn’t go far enough to pierce through that filter bubble, though. The public posts it returns aren’t ranked in a way that could help you understand what the wider world thinks about a subject, as it’s instead a simple reverse chronological stream of public posts on the matter.  If anything, the feature feels more like Facebook’s attempt to step into Twitter’s territory by allowing users to see a feed of public commentary about a timely subject. But unlike Twitter, once you’ve clicked through to see the full stream, it doesn’t update with new posts as they come in, the way Facebook’s News Feed does. News Feed will pop up a “New Posts” alert that will scroll you back to the top to see the latest content. “Latest Conversations,” ironically, remains a static page. To see new posts, you have to tap to go back to the main search results where the unit appears, then tap again on the “See All” link to refresh the screen with the latest posts. That’s odd, given that the post counter at the top of the page continually updates — the expectation is that the stream of posts would, too. The unit doesn’t appear for all search queries, only those that are seeing a lot of activity at the time of the search. While the feature feels more experimental, Facebook confirmed with TechCrunch that it’s rolling out to users now. We’re currently seeing it in Facebook’s mobile app, but not on the web.

            "257 Skimlinks has figured out how publishers could unshackle themselves from Facebook\n",
            "The conventional thinking about profiling online users is that Facebook (in particular) has enormous amounts of profile data about your tastes, while Amazon has equivalent quantities of data about your shopping habits. While both are true to some extent, the reality is that your liking of cat videos and flirt-Liking work colleagues’ posts doesn’t amount to a heck of a lot, while Amazon’s knowledge of you is locked inside your re-orders of washing powder. Admittedly that might be a simplification… Suffice it to say, a better scenario would be a platform that could look at all your actual purchasing behaviour (perhaps even start to make predictions about it?) and which was not locked inside the big social platforms or e-commerce giants? What if it was available to all publishers and content owners, and all the data, where users were\n",
            "anonymized, got larger and larger as more and more publishers joined? Would this not free them of the shackles of Facebook/Amazon/Google, and the like? It turns out just such as platform exists, and has emerged from left-field out of a hot new trend in online publishing. So-called “Editorial commerce-related content” emerged from early commerce-related blogs like Wirecutter, but have quickly caught on amongst bigger publishers like Buzzfeed, who have realised that placing buy links inside content could be a way out of the declining world of online advertising. Indeed, even reverse-engineering shopping habits and over-laying that data inside an ad network has many untold possibilities. The company spear-heading this new approach is Skimlinks. Better known for their platform which give publishers control of how affiliate schemes appear, this mid-stage startup has recently launched a new product aimed at mining the big data it has accumulated about users shopping habits, and make that available to all its publisher clients. “The public success of publishers such as Wirecutter, BuzzFeed and Gizmodo encouraged other publishers to similarly embrace a strategy to drive incremental revenue and deep audience insights,” says co-founder and CEO Alicia Navarro. “This weaving of commerce into editorial content is also enabling publishers to hire dedicated staff to fully capitalize on these strategies; 80 percent of top Skimlinks’  publishers hired dedicated commerce editors last year.” Today it’s releasing new metrics about just how successful this new approach is becoming. So for instance, editorial content from its publisher network of 1.5M domains has now driven nearly $1 billion of ecommerce transactions in 2016. This resulted in a 38% year-over-year increase in revenue, with Skimlinks hitting $36 million in gross revenue for the year. The new year is continuing this trend and the company says it is poised to hit yearly revenues of $50 million, and will hit profitability by year-end.\n",
            "It’s now working with Condé Nast, BuzzFeed and Mail Online. The key driver is its “Audiences” data product which is launched in\n",
            "January 2016. With this, they now have 54 percent market penetration in the top 100 US and UK content publishers. The company claims this is now one of the largest global sources of declared shopping intent data available to marketers programmatically. This is also independent from any particular platform or media buy. Because of this it has opted-in data from 99.9 percent of sites, 80% of all pageviews, and visibility into the shopping journeys of more than 1.5B cookied users. The publishers that opt-in to Audiences share in the revenues from Skimlinks’ data sales, but can also access the data for their own internal ad targeting and user insights. This creates a virtuous circle: publishers create more content that drives affiliate revenue as well as creating more user interactions, which in turn drives insights into the shopping behaviors of their readers, which fuel’s publishers’ strategic choices about what content to publish. Navarro says: “Amazon have a similar dataset to us, because they also offer publisher javascript-based tools and have their own conversion data. However, they only sell their data to buyers who spend on their network, and of course, their data only includes Amazon. They also don’t compensate publishers for the data they use from publisher sites running their widgets. Skimlinks has data for every merchant, not just Amazon, and we share revenues with publishers who opt-in to be part of our data co-operative. Currently 80% of all our publisher’s impressions are opted-in, giving us data on over 1.1 billion uniques a month.” “Facebook and Google currently use their data collected from publisher pages to optimise their ad targeting algorithms, which – due to their huge scale – make them the most performant players in the market. They attract 85% of all ad dollars, leaving 15% for every other publisher,” she adds. Let’s face it, that 15% ends up funding journalism. Facebook or Google (or Amazon) don’t share their ad revenues with the publishers whose data is used to make their advertising algorithms so good. Skimlinks does. It not only shares the revenues, but also give publishers access to the data for free in their own data management platform or ad server. That means any one publisher now has the scale and ad targeting capability of a Facebook. For free. This potentially makes it the largest shopping intent data co-operative available programmatically in the world. So far it has raised $23 million in investment and is HQ’d in London. Now, the sceptic in me notes that publishers collectively can’t mach the Facebook/Google/Amazon “triumvirate”. However, the fact that so many publishers are deserting the Facebook native platform, as well as wondering about such things as Google AMP, indicates to me that Skimlinks might just be onto something big here.  \n",

            "258 Facebook deflates filter bubbles by letting you follow topics, not just Pages\n",
            "Facebook gets a lot of flack for just reinforcing your world views in its News Feed echo chamber instead of challenging your opinions. That’s because you choose exactly which friends and Pages to follow, so liberals might skip Fox News or Breitbart while conservatives avoid The Atlantic and Huffington Post. But Facebook’s newest feature could bring a wider range of sources to your News Feeds. Today TechCrunch spotted  a “Topics to Follow” box in the News Feed that lets you swipe through a range of themes like Theater, Horror Movies or Photography. Tapping “Follow” brings you to a dedicated feed for that theme populated by a collection of Pages that publish about the topic. You can tap through to see all the Pages you’ll then see public posts from in your main feed.  Facebook  confirms this is a new “small test,” and a spokesperson provided this statement: “We’re testing ways for people to subscribe directly to topics in News Feed so they can see more stories about topics they like. In addition to following specific Pages, this is a new way to follow the general topics you’re interested in.” If the feature proves useful, it might get rolled out more widely. But it could also be scrapped if people find it confusing or unhelpful. For now it almost seems that Facebook purposefully strayed away from controversial or polarizing topics. The most incendiary one I saw might have been “Ocean Science & Conservation.” But you can imagine how the feature might work for topics like “Donald Trump,” “Healthcare,” “Refugees,”  “Taxes,” “Terrorism” or others. By pulling from news sources across the political spectrum, Facebook could expose people to contrarian views that might make them think twice about believing everything they read, question the bias in their preferred sources and understand how their fellow citizens perceive news. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has disputed the prevalence of filter bubbles, citing a study by Facebook from 2015 that showed 23 percent of users’ friends are of the opposing political affiliation, and nearly 29 percent of News Feed Stories contain views that conflict with a user’s ideology. Yet Zuckerberg has become more receptive to this criticism over time. The new feature aligns with a solution he outlined in the 6,000 word humanitarian manifesto he published earlier this year. It cites entrenched opinions fostered by hyperbolic media as another big problem beyond fake news. “Our goal must be to help people see a more complete picture, not just alternate perspectives . . . We must be careful how we do this,” Zuckerberg writes. “Research shows that some of the most obvious ideas, like showing people an article from the opposite perspective, actually deepen polarization by framing other perspectives as foreign.” Instead, he proposes something similar to the Topics to Follow feature. “A more effective approach is to show a range of perspectives, let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right,” Zuckerberg suggests. One issue is that people might feel duped if they suddenly see a contrarian perspective from an outlet on the far end of the political spectrum that they didn’t realize they’d followed through a Topic. Twitter tried something a few years back, allowing you to follow a Moment so you’d see tweets about that topic from a range of people without having to find and follow them individually.  All the fake news and filter bubble controversy surrounding the election hasn’t slowed Facebook’s growth, according to its successful earnings report yesterday. Monthly active users are up 17 percent since Q1 2016, which is faster than it’s grown since 2013. Still, it needs to constantly find more ways to keep people coming back to the decade-old News Feed, like taking the work out of tracking their interests.  \n",

            "Virtual reality may be in desperate need of some content, but Facebook’s Oculus  will now be focusing its efforts on investing in rather than creating virtual reality. Oculus VP of Content Jason Rubin announced today that the company will shut down its award-winning cinematic VR division, Oculus Story Studio. “After careful consideration, we’ve decided to shift our focus away from internal content creation to support more external production,” Rubin wrote. “As part of that shift, we’ll be winding down Story Studio.” At the Oculus Connect developer conference in October, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed that the company had already invested more than $250 million in original VR content and would be putting another quarter billion into original content plays as it looked to give Rift and Gear VR users something to watch on their headsets.  Rubin details that $50 million of its committed funds will now be set aside for the company to invest exclusively in non-gaming, interactive content. Oculus Story Studio was founded in 2014 to explore creating original cinematic content for the virtual reality company. Last year the studio won an Emmy for its animated short Henry, a Pixar-esque story about a prickly hedgehog that loves to give hugs. In the midst of creating its latest project, Dear Angelica, the Story Studio team created an extensive VR painting product called Quill that allowed users to create content inside virtual reality. As a part of the shutdown, Quill will continue to be available for download in the Oculus store, but will no longer be receiving updates, though Oculus may open the software’s source code to third-party developers. The sudden shutdown comes as the studio is in the midst of producing its fourth major project, The Wolves in the Walls, which the company confirms has now been cancelled. About 50 people will be let go at Oculus Story Studio as a part of the shutdown. An Oculus spokesperson tells TechCrunch that the employees will also be able to apply for other positions elsewhere within Oculus or Facebook. Update: A previous version of this article misrepresented Oculus’ plans to open-source Story Studio’s Quill software, no such plans have been announced.  \n",

            "260 Facebook’s Express Wi-Fi launches commercially in India\n",
            "Express Wi-Fi is one of Facebook’s many connectivity initiatives under its internet.org umbrella. Unlike more futuristic projects like the Aquila drone, though, the emphasis here is on existing Wi-Fi technologies and allowing local entrepreneurs to resell internet access. In India, Facebook  is currently working with a number of local ISPs and 500 local entrepreneurs, but that number is about to grow quite a bit. As the company announced today, it’s now launching the service commercially in India and has partnered with the Indian telecom firm Bharti Airtel, which plans to bring an additional 20,000 hotspots online, starting in the next few months. The other ISPs involved in the project so far are  AirJaldi in Uttarakhand, LMES in Rajasthan, Tikona in Gujarat and soon with Shaildhar in Meghalaya. The company previously launched the service commercially in Kenya and it’s also trialing it in Tanzania, Nigeria and Indonesia. As James Beldock, Facebook’s product manager for Express Wi-Fi, told me, the idea behind this project was always to create an entrepreneurial grassroots base for the service. That means Airtel and its other ISP partners will continue this work with local entrepreneurs who want to resell internet access to their communities. “Our strategy has always been that these programs work if they are financially sustainable for the partners we work with,” Beldock told me, and added that while Facebook provides the software, it’s the ISPs and their partners that decide what to charge, for example. “Facebook’s strategy is to enable partners to make connectivity at scale sustainable, not to dictate pricing.” Wi-Fi, of course, is a far easier onramp to the internet than most other means of getting online, Beldock stressed. After all, you don’t need a SIM card or data plan to go online. It also offers a low-cost way of getting online (with daily, weekly or monthly data packs) and the partnership with local entrepreneurs could help the local economy. As Beldock noted, the challenge of expanding the service to other countries isn’t so much technical as it is about understanding the local markets and needs. Chances are, though, that we’ll soon see more commercial launches in the other countries where Facebook is already testing the service.  \n",

            "261 Zuckerberg thinks Facebook was ‘late’ to competing with Snapchat, is now ‘ahead’\n",
            "Mark Zuckerberg believes Facebook has leapfrogged Snapchat in the race to provide visual communication thanks to the launch of Facebook’s augmented reality Camera Effects platform. On today’s strong earnings call after Facebook beat estimates in Q1 2017, Zuckerberg said (emphasis mine): “I think we were a little bit late to the trend initially around making cameras the center of how sharing works. But I do think at this point we’re pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we’re building, and making an open platform I think is a big step forward. A lot of people are using these products across our family of apps. And I would expect us to continue leading the way forward on this from this point on.” Meanwhile, when asked about monetizing augmented reality, Zuckerberg described how he imagines that one day you’ll be able to point the Facebook app’s camera at an object, the app will recognize what it is and you could then see a Buy button pop up. For now, though, Facebook isn’t allowing any unauthorized advertising, logos, branding or commerce experiences on its AR platform. Facebook’s AR Studio tools allows outside developers to build augmented reality experiences for Facebook’s platform Zuckerberg’s comments today mesh with what he told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of Facebook’s F8 conference last month. In response to criticism about copying Snapchat, Zuckerberg said, “I guess I’m not that worried about that . . . The first chapter that made sense was to release products that people were familiar with . . . but the unique thing that we’re going to do is we’re not just going to build basic cameras, we’re going to build the first mainstream augmented reality platform.” This platform means Facebook will enlist the help of outside developers to build AR content for users, rather than trying to build them all alone. This contrasts with Snapchat’s anti-developer attitude that could force it to try to build the breadth of AR by itself. The platform could let Facebook offer thousands of different AR selfie filters, make-believe objects and interactive experiences while Snapchat currently only shows around 20. Snapchat’s pioneering approach to visual communication and its curated set of AR selfie filters gave it a big lead over Facebook. But with its massive headcount, steady profits and history with developers, Facebook has closed the gap. Now as the battle rages on to fill the vast physical world with augmented reality, Facebook’s heft and outside help could give it the advantage.  \n",

            "262 Facebook beats in Q1 with $8.03B revenue, faster growth to 1.94B users\n",
            "Facebook had another strong quarter, beating estimates to start 2017. It scored $8.03 billion in revenue and $1.04 GAAP actual EPS in Q1 compared to $0.87 EPS estimate. It earned that from 1.94 billion users, up from 1.86 billion last quarter, growing at a faster 4.3 percent compared to 3.91 perecent last quarter. At this rate Facebook should hit 2 billion total users in Q2. Daily active users reached 1.28 billion, up from 1.23 billion last quarter. While fake news, video violence, and copying Snapchat have all been fixtures of the Facebook news cycle, its user growth actually grew during the time period. Facebook added 3 million monthly users in the lucrative but saturated US & Canada market, though the Asia-Pacific region was the big driver, where Facebook added 43 million users. The company told investors that “Facebook is no longer reporting non-GAAP expenses, income, tax rate, and earnings per share (EPS).” That means it will be more prominently disclosing stock-based compensation in its expenses, which is important since tech companies like Facebook pay employees lots of stock that vests over time to keep them from leaving. [Correction: TechCrunch and several other publications wrongly compared the new GAAP actual EPS with the non-GAAP analyst estimate, since Facebook no longer reports non-GAAP financials. Since Facebook’s GAAP actual EPS was $1.04 compared to the analyst estimate of $0.87, Facebook actually beat the street this quarter, rather than having mixed results as we originally reported.] Facebook beat analyst estimates on revenue, which were $7.83 billion. Facebook had closed the market earlier today down 0.68 percent at $151.80. Shares dropped 2.37 percent in after-hours trading. Today’s report shows that running out of News Feed ad space hasn’t prevented Facebook from continuing to grow its revenue.  Mobile now counts for 85 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, compared to 84 percent last quarter, accounting for $6.7 billion in ad revenue. Facebook earned $3.06 billion in profit in Q1, up 76% year-over-year while revenue grew 49% year-over-year. Facebook managed to slow the decline of its games payments business, with it earning $175 million in Q1 compared to $180 million last quarter and $195 million in Q3. Facebook stopped reporting mobile-only users. Headcount grew to 18,770 people, up 38 percent YOY. Facebook’s total costs were $4.7 billion, giving it a 41% operating margin, down from 52% margin last quarter. Facebook’s focus on the developing world with apps like the 200 million-user Facebook Lite, recently rolled-out Messenger Lite, and new Instagram offline mode are paying off. Average revenue per user in the Rest Of World region hit $1.27, up 40% in a year. During the earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg gave an overview of Facebook’s work on its new mission to “build community” that the CEO described in his humanitarian manifesto in February. Progress includes getting people to join community groups, launching Community Help for organizing disaster and crisis relief, and launching Townhall to connect people to their elected representatives. One important piece of news from the call was the first indication of the performance of WhatsApp Status, the Facebook-owned messaging app’s Snapchat Stories clone. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp Status now has 175 million daily users just 10 weeks after launch, making it larger than Snapchat as a whole.  But Zuckerberg’s most electric comments came when he characterized Facebook’s progress in visual communication and augmented reality versus competitors. While he didn’t name Snapchat, the comparison was implied when he said (emphasis mine): “I think we were a little bit late to the trend initially around making cameras the center of how sharing works. But I do think at this point we’re pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we’re building, and making an open platform I think is a big step forward. A lot of people are using these products across our family of apps. And I would expect us to continue leading the way forward on this from this point on.” The CEO seems bullish on outside developers helping Facebook to produce a wider ranger of AR content than Snap can itself. When asked about monetizing AR, Zuckerberg brought up how object recognition could enable floating Buy buttons on real world things. Another significant point from the call was Facebook’s growing emphasis on long-form video and purposeful viewing, rather than the short-form video people spontaneously discover in the feed today. Efforts to thwart ad blockers have also succeeded, with CFO David Wehner saying Facebook served 32% more ad impressions in Q1 2017 versus Q1 2016. eMarketer estimates that Facebook will generate $36.29 billion in net digital ad revenue in 2017, up 35% from last year. That would give it the second largest share of the global online ad market with16.2%, behind Google’s 33%. 45% of Facebook ad revenue is expected to come from the US.  While Facebook doesn’t break out Instagram financials, eMarketer expects it to earn $3.92 billion in global ad revenue, or 12.3% of Facebook’s ad revenue.  “Advertisers continue to report positive results from their ads on Facebook, but they remain concerned about things like fake news and the measurement glitches that Facebook has revealed” says eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. “How the company addresses these and other concerns will be a key factor that determines whether revenue growth continues as strongly in the next few quarters and years as it has in the recent past.” Q1 saw Facebook spin up several new products that could turn into serious money-makers for the social network. Following the success of Instagram Stories, Facebook continued its efforts to clone Snapchat with the launch of Messenger Day, Facebook Stories, and WhatsApp Status. These clones could dampen growth for Snapchat while eventually sucking in marketing dollars from the ads it will likely insert between Stories as it does on Instagram. Competing with LinkedIn, Facebook launched job opening posts that can be turned into ads. Facebook began testing ad breaks inside of recorded videos as well as Live broadcasts, and will keep 45% of the ad revenue while paying creators 55%.  But Facebook saw trouble with Oculus, paying $300 million (plus $200 million from Oculus founders) to Zenimax after losing a lawsuit about stolen intellectual property. Co-founder Palmer Luckey left the company, and Oculus reduced the price of its Rift headset amidst slow sales of tethered VR hardware across the industry. The biggest story of the quarter was Facebook’s on-going struggles to fight fake news and offensive content. It’s begun working with outside fact checkers, hired a former New York Times product manager to run news product, made banned content reporting easier, and today announced it will hire 3000 people to speed up vetting of flagged content. Yet even that controversy hasn’t seemed to slow down the social juggernaut.  \n",

            "If you’re a big fan of some more mid-core or hardcore games on your smartphone, you might periodically get a reminder to pop in the game to do something. But that requires booting up the game — and it may also require digging through a labyrinth of menus to figure out what you’re trying to accomplish. Blackstorm Labs  is trying to make the process of getting into that game seamless by booting it instantly from a messenger, but now it’s also trying to take away some of that tedium to handle more of the administrative elements of a game — like knowing when to log back in — with an AI gamebot that lives right in Messenger. Think of it as a more robust notification system that tells you when big things are happening in a game (like a reward timer is expiring or a friend is asking for help), with additional context and the ability to page through multiple options right within the notification itself. “The way we see it, it’s not just a way to notify people, it’s a way to have a mechanism for having a conversation with players,” Blackstorm Labs co-founder Ernestine Fu said. “A player can complete a wide range of different actions within a couple seconds. The player doesn’t have to open up the game to do that. If you think about how people use Facebook  Messenger, you can see a lot of people switching between chat messages. Being able to blend that into someone’s daily life, we see that as a more natural behavior.” It’s starting off with the company’s first big HTML5 game called EverWing, a kind of bullet hell fantasy shooter that lives in Facebook Messenger and is built around the kinds of social concepts you might expect with a bigger online game like World of Warcraft. It’s more lightweight — it exists within Messenger — but it’s trying to emulate that same feeling of bringing players together to accomplish joint tasks. One example recently launched is Boss Raids, where players in a group cooperate to try to take down a larger enemy in their sessions for larger rewards. Blackstorm Labs is trying to have a notification system that seems more adaptable and even more conversational. Here are a couple of things it’s geared toward: Players can get updated when energy is refilled for their Boss Raid sessions; it can send messages for group power-ups when someone shares a special ability; and narrating the quests, with updates to describe the challenges and progress of those quests. This all seems like table stacks for an online game like World of Warcraft that has in-game managers for all these things, but the goal of all this is to have all this functionality baked inside a bot that can handle complex tasks to keep the tedium away from a player and get their attention when something fun is available. “At the end of the day we want users to focus on the most exciting aspects and offloading the stress around setting alarm clocks,” Fu said. “You need to just manage all those timing for quests, things like Boss Raids energy and refilling that, and be able to just focus on the best experience from playing the game. Users are constantly jumping between different apps and having only seconds in the day when they’re standing in line at a coffee shop to respond to a friend on messenger or send a quick text. They’re not gonna open up an entire game, but to quickly play the game in those short moments throughout the day, that’s a way you can continue to collect coins or go on quests or help defeat a monster boss or do these things in the few spare moments.”  EverWing is getting another feature that allows people to share in the process of unlocking more powerful rewards by spending their in-game resources. Called Group Shopping Sprees, players can share their rare gets in a group, which enables an increased chance of getting those rare items for a short while within Messenger. The thing to note here is it’s again a more context-rich notification that gets users engaged with a more robust heads-up on what’s going on in the game. Blackstorm Labs — which has raised $33.5 million — started as a company that’s trying to build a sort of post-App Store world for developers. Given the fidelity and demands of a game, it makes sense to start there as a big showcase as to how the technology can quickly get a big app up and running in a lightweight fashion. And bringing all these kinds of features to an in-stream messenger bot is just another example of the kind of potential empowering developers within these new platforms, and the ideas on which they can execute.  \n",

            "264 Facebook to add 3,000 to team reviewing posts with hate speech, crimes, and other harming posts\n",
            "A week after news broke of multiple videos of suicides posted on Facebook remaining on the site for hours, the company has announced a new plan to add 3,000 more people to its operations team to screen for harmful videos and other posts to respond to them more quickly in the future. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook  said that this would be in addition to the 4,500 people already working in this capacity. What is not clear is whether these are full-time employees or contractors, and how screeners will, in effect, be screened. It’s a big hiring move, but is it enough? The company currently has close to 2 billion users — we’ll be getting an update on that number later today when Facebook posts its quarterly earnings (interesting timing to release this on just ahead of those) — and Zuckerberg said that there are “millions of reports” received every week. “If we’re going to build a safe community, we need to respond quickly,” Zuckerberg wrote in a post earlier today. “We’re working to make these videos easier to report so we can take the right action sooner — whether that’s responding quickly when someone needs help or taking a post down.” The move to add more human curation into the mix is nevertheless a step in the right direction. To date, the company has put more emphasis on building algorithms and mechanisms for people to report on friends or even themselves if they are concerned. In March, it launched a new set of suicide prevention tools. A month later it new tech to combat revenge porn. While the reviewers will be given a role to speed up some of the bottleneck that results in the gap between reporting content and that content being taken down, Facebook said it will continue to work with authorities and also continue to invest in — yes — more technology. “We’re going to make it simpler to report problems to us, faster for our reviewers to determine which posts violate our standards and easier for them to contact law enforcement if someone needs help. As these become available they should help make our community safer,” Zuckerberg wrote. As the world’s biggest social network, Facebook has held a contentious place in the ongoing debate about what role social media is playing in how information is spread around the world today. During recent political events like the U.S. elections and the referendum in the U.K., many accused Facebook of helping to disseminate inaccurate spins, or downright false information, about the issues at hand and candidates, connecting that dissemination directly to the outcomes of those voting events. Facebook has on the one hand claimed to have a statistically small influence, while at the same time recently pledging to do more to try to combat the spread of false information on its platform, both with more human curation and the creation of more tools for people to flag and take the edge off of posts intentionally created to be incendiary and viral, but perhaps not ultimately to enlighten anyone at all.    \n",

            "265 Facebook replaces Oculus computer vision head at center of underage sex scandal\n",
            "The head of computer vision at Facebook’s virtual reality subsidiary, Oculus,  has been replaced following his arrest related to an underage sex sting operation, TechCrunch has learned. Dov Katz was arrested at an Embassy Suites outside of Seattle in late December after allegedly soliciting sex from an undercover officer who he believed, at the time of meeting, was a 15-year-old girl. Katz allegedly agreed to pay $300 for sex. A current screenshot of Katz’s LinkedIn profile header. Katz has been replaced by Amir Frenkel, who — according to LinkedIn — joined Facebook in November of last year as director of engineering before transitioning to his role as head of computer vision at Oculus last month. Before joining Facebook, Frenkel served as head of wearables engineering at Google, where he worked on initiatives surrounding the Google Glass and the Project Aura augmented reality products. An Oculus spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that Katz is no longer an employee at the company. This scandal comes at a particularly bad time for Oculus, which has been in the throes of an executive overhaul over the last several months that has seen many of the company’s most prominent employees shifting roles or leaving while the virtual reality company, which Facebook acquired in 2014, grows more organizationally integrated beneath its parent company. In December, Oculus co-founder and CEO Brendan Iribe suddenly announced that he would be stepping down from his role to lead PC-based VR initiatives at the company. Ex-Xiaomi executive Hugo Barra took over the reins of the company last month, but not as Oculus’ CEO. Instead, his title is that of Facebook’s “VP of VR,” overseeing VR initiatives at both Facebook and Oculus. Just a few weeks ago, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey left the company he helped start in his garage following several months of public silence related to a scandal surrounding his funding of an anti-Clinton online action group during the 2016 presidential election. The scandal — and Luckey’s later admission — angered many in the developer community, with some threatening to boycott development on the platform. This situation with Katz has obviously been an outlier during the current leadership woes but has nevertheless been damaging to the company, which is blazing ahead with its computer vision tech as it readies new virtual reality and augmented reality products.  \n",

            "Facebook  may have an issue with gender bias, according to a recent report by The Wall Street Journal. Based on an analysis by an engineer at Facebook, which Facebook told TechCrunch is “incomplete and inaccurate,” code written by female engineers at Facebook gets rejected more often than code written by men at the company. “As we have explained, the Wall Street Journal is relying on analysis that is incomplete and inaccurate – performed by a former Facebook engineer with an incomplete data set,” a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email. “Any meaningful discrepancy based on the complete data is clearly attributable not to gender but to seniority of the employee. In fact, the discrepancy simply reaffirms a challenge we have previously highlighted – the current representation of senior female engineers both at Facebook and across the industry is nowhere near where it needs to be.” According to the analysis, female engineers received 35 percent more rejections of their code than male engineers. The employee’s analysis also found that women waited 3.9 percent longer to get their code accepted, and received 8.2 percent more comments and questions than men. The WSJ noted that it was not able to independently verify the results of the analysis nor assess the methodology of it. In response to the employee’s analysis, Facebook did its own study, according to The WSJ. Facebook Head of Infrastructure Jay Parikh reportedly said the gap in rejection rate was not due to gender, but rank. So, Facebook’s argument is essentially that because there are not as many women in higher-ranked engineering roles, their code is subject to more scrutiny. But it’s problematic that women, which only make up 17 percent of Facebook’s technical department, are not in higher-ranking roles. I’d personally love to see the breakdown of ranks in Facebook’s engineering department, but that’s not something Facebook has detailed in its diversity reports.  \n",

            "This morning Facebook’s  AI Research (FAIR) lab released an update to fastText, its super-speedy open-source text classification library. When it was initially released, fastText shipped with pre-trained word vectors for 90 languages, but today it’s getting a boost to 294 languages. The release also brings enhancements to reduce model size and ultimately memory demand. Text  classifiers like fastText make it easy for developers to ship tools that depend on underlying language analysis. Flagging clickbait headlines or filtering spam both require an underlying model that can interpret and categorize language. From the start, fastText was designed to be implemented on a wide variety of hardware. Unfortunately, in its original state, it still required a few gigabytes of memory to run. This isn’t a problem if you’re working in a state of the art lab, but it’s a deal killer if you’re trying to make things work on mobile. By collaborating with the team that produced another Facebook open-source project, similarity search (FAISS), the company was able to reduce the memory requirement to just a few hundred kilobytes. FAISS addresses some of the inherent bottlenecks that developers face when dealing with huge amounts of data. A massive corpus of information is often best represented in a multi-dimensional vector space. For Facebook and many other companies, optimizing the comparison of these vectors for comparing content with user preferences and comparing content with other content is critical. The approach of the FAISS team ended up playing a big role in reducing the memory demands of fastText. “A few key ingredients, namely feature pruning, quantization, hashing, and re-training, allow us to produce text classification models with tiny size, often less than 100kB when trained on several popular datasets, without noticeably sacrificing accuracy or speed,” said the Facebook authors of a December 2016 paper entitled “fastText.zip: Compressing Text Classification Models.” The authors went on to hypothesize that additional model size reduction might be possible in the future. The challenge isn’t so much shrinking the models as it is maintaining accuracy. But until then, engineers can access the updated library on GitHub and begin tinkering today.  \n",

            "Facebook  has denied it offers tools to advertisers to target users when they are in vulnerable emotional states. Yesterday The Australian published a report claiming Facebook uses algorithms to target advertising when users of its service are feeling insecure — including targeting children as young as 14 when they are feeling vulnerable. The report, based on a confidential 2017 internal document seen by the newspaper, claimed that by monitoring posts, pictures, interactions and Internet activity in real-time Facebook’s algorithms can identify “moments when young people need a confidence boost”. Facebook can determine when young people feel “stressed”, “defeated”, “overwhelmed”, “anxious”, “nervous”, “stupid”, “silly”, “useless”, and a “failure”, the report claimed, suggesting the company allows advertisers to target users based on its algorithmic understanding of their well-being. Detailed information on mood shifts among young people is “shareable under non-disclosure agreement only”, the document added. Contacted by TechCrunch about the newspaper’s claims a Facebook spokesperson described the report as “misleading” , and denied the company provides tools for advertisers to target Facebook users based on their emotional state. “The premise of this article is misleading. We do not offer tools to target people based on their emotional state. The analysis done by an Australian researcher was intended to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook. It was never used to target ads and was based on data that was anonymous and aggregated,” the spokesperson said. However Facebook is not denying the existence of the document, nor its apparent ability to assess users’ psychological states based on ongoing tracking of their online activity. In earlier comments to the newspaper Facebook also apologized, and said it had opened an investigation to “understand the process failure and improve our oversight”. “We will undertake disciplinary and other processes as appropriate,” it added. Facebook has an established process for reviewing internal research, and TechCrunch understands the research in question did not follow that process — hence the internal review. It’s by no means the first time questions have been raised about Facebook’s approach to the emotional well-being of its users. The company got into ethical hot water back in 2014 when it emerged it had experimented on some 700,000 users without their consent or knowledge, to see whether it could influence how they felt. Facebook’s exercise in mass emotional manipulation, which was actually carried out in 2012, involved it showing users either more positive or more negative content to see if it could influence their mood. When details of the internal experiment emerged it was roundly condemned as unethical. Last fall the company also garnered criticism for its ad targeting practices after it emerged it was allowing ads to be targeted based on users’ ethnic affinity — with concerns this could enable discriminatory advertising. Facebook subsequently disabled ethnic affinity targeting for housing, employment and credit-related ads. And while the social media giant has distanced itself from these latest suggestions it’s tracking users emotions for marketing-related sales opportunities, a longitudinal study of Facebook usage, conducted by external researchers and published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in February, claims to have found an association between activity on the social network and negative feelings of well-being. “The negative associations of Facebook use were comparable to or greater in magnitude than the positive impact of offline interactions, which suggests a possible tradeoff between offline and online relationships,” the researchers wrote in the abstract to the paper. More recently, Facebook has also been accused of allowing data on millions of its users to be covertly harvested by a Trump campaign affiliate — and potentially used to target political advertising at Americans ahead of the 2016 Presidential election. Although it has refuted these claims, telling the Intercept in March: “Our investigation to date has not uncovered anything that suggests wrongdoing.”  \n",

            "Facebook’s  role in spreading news, especially fake news, has been in the spotlight since last year’s presidential election. Now it’s promoting Alex Hardiman to lead its news efforts on the product side. Hardiman worked at The New York Times, most recently as vice president of news products, until joining Facebook last year. She wrote on Facebook that her new role will involve working with news organizations to monetize and develop new formats, while also partnering “with teams in Facebook to continue curbing the spread of false news.”  Recode previously reported that Facebook was looking to hire a head of news products to combat fake news. The fact that a product person will be playing a key role in this fight seems reflective of the approach that the company wants to take on these issues — an approach that emphasizes technology over editorial involvement (though again, Hardiman said she’ll be working on other teams, including the company’s new journalism project). Even beyond fake news, Hardiman seems to have a lot of work to do, with news publishers increasingly resistant to Facebook’s Instant Articles, largely due to the lack of monetization options. Still, she sounds charged up about the challenge. Hardiman wrote: Taking this role is a deeply personal decision for me. My great-grandmother was a radio and television pioneer in the midwest and spent her life providing Americans with access to high quality news. My grandfather spent his career as a broadcast journalist tackling racial discrimination and social injustice. I grew up in News, spending 10 years at The New York Times transforming the company into a mobile-first organization with products like The Times’s iPhone news app … The weight and opportunity of this challenge is both humbling and thrilling, and I can’t wait to get started.

            "270 Facebook gives its Marketplace a colorful redesign\n",
            "Facebook  has given its Marketplace a bit of a visual overhaul, with new colorful icons and improved search and filtering features. The Craigslist competitor, first launched in October 2016, is Facebook’s major entry point into local commerce. Today, the Marketplace sits in a dedicated tab at the bottom of Facebook’s app, where its ever-present red badge forces you to click through. (Or is that just me?) The changes are more about making the marketplace easier to use, with a now-scrollable list of item categories that appear as candy-colored, rounded icons. At launch, Marketplace’s navigational elements were much simpler. Four buttons at the top encouraged users to snap a photo of an item to sell, tap into categories, search or easily access their own postings.  These same features are still available post-redesign, except that, today, delving into an individual category only takes one tap, instead of two. The idea here is to encourage better discovery, as most people come to the Marketplace with a goal in mind. They need a piece of furniture, or an appliance, or they want to browse for deals on second-hand items like clothing, purses, baby products or maybe a used smartphone. With the addition of the individual category icons, you can now quickly jump into a particular section. Plus, at the front of the list, there’s also now a handy icon for finding nearby garage sales.  You can filter any section by location and price to narrow the listings returned, either with or without an accompanying keyword search. When you’re browsing a given section, you also can tap onto the filtering options to switch to a different category. These are organized under high-level labels like Home, Entertainment, Clothing & Accessories, Family, Electronics, Hobbies, Vehicles & Bicycles and Classified. Underneath each is a selection of sub-categories you can choose from to narrow your searches. For example, under Electronics you can pick from Mobile Phones or Electronics & Computers. The Classifieds section features the Garage Sales, as well as Housing ads — both of which push Facebook even further into Craigslist territory. These sections, too, now sport the more colorful icons to maintain consistency with the Marketplace’s new look. These features are available on the desktop version of Facebook, as well as mobile, but in a different layout.  Facebook doesn’t share numbers related to how many users have tried Marketplace, number of listings or transactions to date. However, the company did say last fall that there are 450 million people already using “Buy & Sell” groups on Facebook every month, which is the same demographic that would use the new Marketplace. But Marketplace still has a host of competition, and not only from Craigslist. A number of new apps are today catering to buyers and sellers. Beyond eBay, there are apps like OfferUp, LetGo, Mercari and Close5 (also eBay). With so many options for buying and selling, Facebook needs to make Marketplace the simplest and most accessible for its users, or they may turn elsewhere. (But seriously, it needs to drop that annoying red notification badge in the app. We get it, Marketplace exists.) Facebook confirmed the redesign’s launch and says it’s now appearing to everyone who has Marketplace.  \n",

            "Facebook  wants to prove it drives brick-and-mortar foot traffic with its latest feature test. TechCrunch has discovered a previously unreported Facebook feature where users can scan a personalized QR code to score discounts or bonuses when they buy something in-person at certain shops. Some users see the Rewards feature listed in the More tab of their Facebook mobile app. When asked, Facebook told us it has been running the test over the past few months, and provided this statement: “To help businesses continue to connect with customers where they are, we’re running a small test that enables people to use the Facebook app to collect and redeem rewards when they make a purchase at a participating store.” Facebook Rewards Facebook Rewards could benefit users, merchants and the social network. People could earn free discounts just for being Facebook users. Merchants could lure people to their stores, earning a higher margin than the Rewards they give while fostering repeat customers and word-of-mouth promotion. Facebook could become more appealing to users while earning ad revenue from businesses looking to promote their Rewards giveaways via ads. The feature could also give Facebook more data on who buys what where, which it can use to improve the relevance of ad targeting and News Feed content. Snap Inc. has been pushing its own way to drive people to brick-and-mortar stores and track their visits. Brands can buy Sponsored Geofilters ads that let Snapchat users overlay special graphics related to a business over their photos and videos when they’re nearby. Snap then shares this info with the business through its “Snap to Store” program. Facebook has been toying with in-store discounts since 2012 when it launched Offers. It revamped the feature last year, and now Offers can be redeemed both online and offline. They use a special barcode and promo code that’s either scanned at the shop or entered in the online checkout flow. Facebook once said that viral sharing of Offers was a big hit. Facebook Offers Meanwhile, Facebook has been working on a wide variety of ways to “close the loop,” proving how its online ads lead to offline purchases. Facebook works with data providers like Datalogix, Epsilon, Acxiom and BlueKai to index people’s offline purchases. It also has forged partnerships with point of sale software systems Square and Marketo to track which ads lead to purchases, or even just to store visits by matching GPS, Wi-Fi, radio signals, cell towers and beacons with a store’s location coordinates. Rewards seems more positioned as a loyalty program. Instead of the offer having a code to scan, Rewards assigns the user a single personal QR code they can scan everywhere. People could potentially scan their code every time they come to a shop, like building up stamps for a free sandwich on a loyalty program card. Because Facebook Rewards lives in your phone in an app everyone already has rather than a loseable card or a new app you must download, it could compete with Belly, LevelUp, Punchcard and other apps. We’ll see if Facebook gets good enough results from this test to more widely roll-out and promote Rewards. But it’s another unsettling moment where loyalty startups might suddenly find themselves in the path of the big blue steamroller.  \n",

            "272 Facebook sidesteps Snapchat by launching Messenger Lite in over 100 more countries\n",
            "Facebook  is aggressively pursuing the international and developing world markets Snapchat hasn’t prioritized. Facebook Lite recently hit 200 million users, and Instagram just rolled out offline mode for Android. Now after launching Messenger Lite for Android in five countries in October, it’s expanding to over 100 more, including Vietnam, Nigeria, Peru, Turkey, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands. Facebook’s head of Messenger David Marcus announced the rollout today, saying “Making sure that everyone can have a great experience with Messenger irrespective of the age of their smartphone is very important to us.” [Correction: Facebook and Marcus both incorrectly billed today’s near-global rollout as going to 150 more countries. After a bunch of back and forth, with Facebook then saying the number was 132, a spokesperson now tells me it’s unclear what the exact number is, but it’s well over 100. What we do know is where it’s not available: Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Sudan, UK, US and North Korea. We’ve updated this story to reflect that.] Messenger Lite screenshots Messenger Lite offers Messenger’s core features like messaging, photo and link sharing and stickers, but lacks the more data-intensive new features like Messenger Day, camera effects and the outside developer app platform. The app was made to be a small file so it downloads quickly and doesn’t take up much space on memory-constrained old phones. It’s designed to minimize data use to save people money and still work on slow or unstable connections like 2G networks. It works offline and delivers messages when you regain connection, and is compatible with almost any Android phone, including the old Gingerbread OS. Now at 1.2 billion users, most of Messenger’s audience is outside the United States. If Facebook can make it more convenient for them to use its chat app instead of standard and more expensive SMS, it creates a big reason to stay in the Facebook family of apps. Messaging has emerged as the center of the mobile experience, and owning it worldwide is crucial to Facebook’s continued power. Snap Inc.   \n",

            "273 Facebook announces plan to fight misinformation campaigns\n",
            "Facebook  made its most direct statements about how the platform has been used to spread misinformation in a report released today by its security team. The report acknowledges how actors created a coordinated campaign on the platform to spread misinformation during the 2016 U.S. election, and explains measures Facebook is taking to combat it. “Our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected,” the reports’ authors — Facebook CSO Alex Stamos and Threat Intelligence team members Jen Weedon and William Nuland — wrote. “The reality is that not everyone shares our vision, and some will seek to undermine it — but we are in a position to help constructively shape the emerging information ecosystem by ensuring our platform remains a safe and secure environment for authentic civic engagement.” Facebook calls the campaigns “information operations” and says the goals of such campaigns are usually to distort or manipulate political sentiment. Ordinary users can get caught up in the operations and take part in the spread of misinformation, Facebook said. The company’s response includes collaboration with other organizations to educate users, undermining campaigns that have a financial motivation, creating new products that slow down the spread of fake news and informing users when they encounter untrustworthy information. Facebook explains that information operations on the platform often manifest in three ways: targeted data collection, content creation, and false amplification. Stealing and publishing data allows actors to control public discourse, the company said, and that data can then be amplified across fake Facebook profiles. These tactics allow operations to sway public opinion about specific issues, sow distrust in political institutions, and spread confusion. This kind of behavior is often attributed to bots, but Facebook claims that most of the activity it sees on its network isn’t automated. “In the case of Facebook, we have observed that most false amplification in the context of information operations is not driven by automated processes, but by coordinated people who are dedicated to operating inauthentic accounts,” Facebook said. The company added that specific language skills and knowledge of regional political context indicated that those involved in the misinformation campaigns were humans, not bots. To fight back, Facebook is amping up its efforts to detect false amplification. It’s trying to block the creation of fake accounts and use machine learning to detect abuse.  The company says that the new measures are proving effective in France, where an election is currently underway. “In France, for example, as of April 13, these improvements recently enabled us to take action against over 30,000 fake accounts,” the report says. Facebook used the recent U.S. election of Donald Trump as a case study into misinformation on its platform. The company concluded that a coordinated campaign existed, “with the intent of harming the reputation of specific political targets.” The campaign included inauthentic Facebook accounts that were used to amplify certain themes and information, the report notes, adding: These incidents employed a relatively straightforward yet deliberate series of actions: Private and/or proprietary information was accessed and stolen from systems and services (outside of Facebook); Dedicated sites hosting this data were registered; Fake personas were created on Facebook and elsewhere to point to and amplify awareness of this data; Social media accounts and pages were created to amplify news accounts of and direct people to the stolen data. From there, organic proliferation of the messaging and data through authentic peer groups and networks was inevitable Although Facebook admitted it was the unwitting host of a disinformation campaign during the election, the company said that the reach of this operation was “statistically very small” in comparison with overall political activity and engagement. Facebook also said it did not have enough data to definitively attribute the campaign to its creators, but nodded to a report published by the Director of National Intelligence which attributed hacking campaigns during the election season to Russian operatives and said that Facebook’s data does not contradict the findings of the Director. Putting the responsibility for fighting misinformation under the purview of its security team is an interesting move for Facebook, indicating that the company views the problem as a security risk similar to hacking or fraud. The company said it would continue to work directly with politicians and campaigns to make sure they use the social network securely. “Our dedicated teams focus daily on account integrity, user safety, and security, and we have implemented additional measures to protect vulnerable people in times of heightened cyber activity such as elections periods, times of conflict or political turmoil, and other high profile events.”  \n",

            "274 Government requests for Facebook user account data up 9% in second half of 2016, but content restrictions declined\n",
            "Facebook  today released its latest report on global government requests for the second half of 2016, noting there has been a 9 percent increase in requests for user account data compared with the earlier part of that year, but a 28 percent decrease in content restrictions for violating local law. However, that latter decrease doesn’t necessarily indicate that content restriction-related requests are dropping as a trend, but rather that earlier reporting had been impacted by unusually inflated figures. This was due to a sizable number of requests related to a single image from the terror attack in Paris in 2015. As the social network explained in December when reporting data for the first half of 2016, this category of government requests had seen a sharp increase due to the posting of an image from the Bataclan attack in Paris on November 13, 2015. Facebook today says that its prior two reports were affected by the number of requests from the country to take a particular photo down. The photo in question is detailed on the Government Requests FAQ page, where Facebook states that a division of French law enforcement, L’Office Central de Lutte Contre la Criminalité Liée aux Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication (OCLCTIC), asked Facebook to remove an image taken inside the Bataclan concert venue depicting the remains of several victims. According to French laws, the image was in violation of laws related to protecting human dignity. Facebook says it restricted access to that photo in 32,100 instances in France, but didn’t remove it in other countries because it found the image was not in violation of its Community Standards as it was being used to denounce the attack or show compassion towards the victims. The company today says that content restriction requests declined from 9,663 in the first half of 2016 to 6,944 in the second half. Meanwhile, requests for user account data went up from 59,229 to 64,279 (9%) during that same period. It’s worth noting that around half the U.S. law enforcement requests included a non-disclosure agreement that prohibited Facebook from notifying its users of the government’s action. It made special mention of this, as search warrants are an issue the company is actively fighting. The company said it received an update on a U.S. court case where it was attempting to protect Facebook users from overreaching search warrants. The New York court said Facebook had raised “novel and important substantive issues,” but declined to review the case further, backing up the lower court’s denial of the challenge and calling it “nonappealable.” This is an issue that affects more than just Facebook. As Reuters reported at the time of the ruling, the decision was a significant defeat for not only Facebook, but also internet privacy advocates including the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, as well as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter that supported Facebook’s appeal. Facebook says it’s now working to support legislation that would allow providers like it to formally contest these “defective search warrants.” Facebook today for the first time also shared information about “internet disruptions” that impacted access to Facebook’s products and services, saying these “harm local economies and prevent people from sharing and communicating with their family and friends.” However, in the downloadable report available now on the Facebook Government Requests website, these are not broken out in a separate column. We reached out to Facebook for clarification on this, and the company explained that it’s putting these requests on each country’s page instead of tallying them in the main report. That means you’ll have to click on the country, then check to view if there were service disruptions. If there were not, this information won’t be listed. You can see an example of this figure here on Ethiopia’s page. Facebook lists the number of internet disruptions and also provides a brief statement noting when the disruptions took place and what caused them. For instance, on Ethiopia’s page, it says disruptions “coincided with protests or student exams.” In the current report, Facebook says there are 20 countries where these metrics are detailed.

            "275 Facebook shows Related Articles and fact checkers before you open links\n",
            "Facebook  wants you to think about whether a headline is true and see other perspectives on the topic before you even read the article. In its next step against fake news, Facebook today begins testing a different version of its Related Articles widget that normally appears when you return to the News Feed after opening a link. Now Facebook will also show Related Articles including third-party fact checkers before you read an article about a topic that many people are discussing. Facebook says “That should provide people easier access to additional perspectives and information, including articles by third-party fact-checkers.” Essentially, rather than trying to convince someone that what they just read might be exaggerated, overly biased, or downright false, Facebook wants to raise people’s suspicions before they’re indoctrinated with lies and embellishments. The feature could break you out of your filter bubble before you fall in any deeper.  If you saw a link saying “Chocolate cures cancer!” from a little-known blog, the Related Article box might appear before you click to show links from the New York Times or a medical journal noting that while chocolate has antioxidants that can lower your risk for cancer, it’s not a cure. If an outside fact checker like Snopes had debunked the original post, that could appear in Related Articles too. Facebook says this is just a test, so it won’t necessarily roll out to everyone unless it proves useful. It notes that Facebook Pages should not see a significant change in the reach of their News Feed posts. There will be no ads surfaced in Related Articles. Facebook originally launched Related Articles in 2013 to surface more interesting links about a topic you just read. But after being criticized for allowing fake news to proliferate during the 2016 US presidential election, Facebook began working with third-party fact checkers to append warnings to disputed articles. Mark Zuckerberg later said in his humanitarian manifesto that one way to combat the problem was by broadening people’s views. “A more effective approach is to show a range of perspectives, let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right. Over time, our community will identify which sources provide a complete range of perspectives so that content will naturally surface more.” Some publishers might not be excited about their more well-known competitors potentially hijacking their readers through Related Articles. But as Facebook seeks to fight the scourge of fake news without necessarily becoming the arbiter of truth itself, its best bet may be to expose a range of opinions about a topic and hope people understand the most outlandish (and viral) takes might not be worth reading.  \n",

            "276 Facebook launches telco infrastructure accelerator with Orange\n",
            "Back in February, the Facebook -led Telecom Infrastructure Project led a call to put $170 million into startups focusing on solutions to improve infrastructure: the switching technologies, engineering, cabling and other components that go into building networking for internet and other communications services. Today comes one more advance on that front: Facebook and the TIP are working with French telco Orange to launch a new “Telecom Track” in the Orange Fab accelerator based in Paris to find more startups to fill this niche. Not too much is being divulged on what kinds of startups are being sought out, except to say that they will need to be based in France for the accelerator. “The partnership will look to pursue the best innovations and talent within the sector,” Orange notes, with the selected startups getting mentorship from Facebook; other TIP members (there are dozens including carriers like Vodafone, Millicom, Airtel and BCS; tech companies like Intel; and infrastructure companies like Nokia); and Orange. This is the first time that Orange has worked with a corporate partner for Fab, and it is the first time that it has launched a specific track around a vertical, an Orange spokesperson confirmed for us. “Facebook is looking forward to working with Orange and TIP to support this start-up accelerator,” said Jay Parikh, head of engineering and infrastructure, Facebook. “Working together, we hope to help identify and support  telecoms network infrastructure innovation while helping pave the way for future breakthroughs.” Startups have until May 14 to apply. Those selected — we’re trying to get more information on just how many but have yet to get a reply — will get €15,000 ($16,300) as part of the program. Three weeks into the program, they get the chance to pitch their ideas to Orange, TIP, Facebook executives, VCs and other partners from across the TIP Ecosystem Accelerator Center network (these are located in other regions like the UK). Then at the end of the year, the selected startups will be invited to pitch at an event in San Francisco. Facebook’s interest in playing a role at the infrastructure level is useful for the company for at least three big reasons. The first is that building out infrastructure in regions that are currently lacking good connectivity is essential if companies like Facebook hope to continue to grow in these regions. And as growth levels off in more mature markets, emerging markets are a key target for Facebook. In areas that are lacking partners for investment, it makes sense for Facebook to step in and chip in some of that funding and run trials of new networking systems — as it has done recently in Uganda, where it is building a 770-kilometer (500-mile) fiber backhaul network with Airtel and BCS. The second is that by having an early hand in building (and potentially owning) some of that infrastructure, Facebook will have a clean and strong level of control over how it can use it longer term. That’s not just for what kind of traffic it chooses to send down those pipes, but also what kind of data it can capture from them. The third is less commercial and perhaps more optimistic: it’s a way for Facebook to use some of its size and power to help shrink the digital divide. (Whether you believe that faster internet and always-on Facebook are good things or not is, perhaps, another question.) For Orange — which itself has an extensive emerging market business — it has been running its Fab accelerators around the world since 2013, with the aim of using them to find new talent and technologies that could help it move away from its more legacy business as a carrier and into newer areas of tech. It’s a strategy that others like Verizon, which owns TechCrunch by way of AOL, is also trying to follow by investing in startups and other initiatives. Indeed, in this case Orange Digital Ventures is also involved and will help with later fundraising for founders in the cohort. “As part of our network evolution towards 5G and future technologies, there is a huge opportunity to innovate at the network level, and a need to support the bright minds and talents that will keep pushing telecoms innovation forward,” said Mari-Noëlle Jégo-Laveissière, EVP of Innovation, Marketing and Technologies, Orange. “We believe that with our partnership with Facebook  and the opening of the new Telecom Track, we are able to encourage and support this community of startups, which has the ability to really disrupt this space and develop new innovation within telecoms.”  \n",

            "277 The $999 SlingStudio makes it easy to produce multi-camera Facebook Live and YouTube streams\n",
            "Sling  Media, the Dish subsidiary you probably know for its Slingbox and Sling TV service, is announcing its SlingStudio hardware today. With this, Sling Media is entering a completely new market because unlike its previous offerings, which targeted consumers, the $999 SlingStudio is meant for video creators who want to produce live video streams for Facebook Live or YouTube. Typically, that’s not only expensive — with the hardware from competitors like TriCaster maker NewTek costing $5,000 or more — but also comes with a steep learning curve. The SlingStudio, on the other hand, is controlled via an iPad  app. Using that app, a video producer can easily record, edit and monitor feeds from four HD video inputs. While you can connect a total of up to 10 cameras and smartphones (iOS and Android via Sling’s Capture app) to the box simultaneously, the editing software makes you focus on four feeds at a time for the live edit, which is typically enough for most setups. If you do have more than four cameras connected, though, it’s easy enough to switch those feeds in at any time (or play pre-recorded videos).  While you only need the SlingStudio hub and the app to get started (plus, of course, a few cameras with HDMI outputs), the company is also launching a couple of accessories that expand the hub’s functionality. These include a $149 battery for using the hub off the electricity grid and a $49 USB-C expander with an ethernet port and the ability to hook up USV drives for saving your recordings for later editing (by default, the SlingStudio records all individual camera feeds plus the live-switched video and audio for later editing in the likes of Adobe Premiere). Maybe the most interesting accessory is the CameraLink, though, which allows you to turn any camera with an HDMI output into a wireless camera for your setup. The CameraLink, which is powered by its own two-hour battery supply, creates a wireless connection to the hub, which allows the camera person to roam up to 300 feet from the hub. It’s worth noting that while the SlingStudio’s focus is clearly on broadcasting live, it can also be used to record all of the incoming streams for post-production.  “We consider SlingStudio a high-production, low-cost concept,” wrote Dish CTO Vivek Khemka in today’s announcement. “It’s powerful and flexible enough to allow directors to knit together professional-quality video with the equipment they already have on hand – from high-end cameras to audio gear to smartphones.” I saw a demo of the SlingStudio at CES in January. At the time, the hardware didn’t have a name or price yet and was still very much in beta. Still, setting up a live stream with multiple cameras looked easy enough and the iPad app made it easy to pull all of the different feeds together. It’s easy to see how a fairly lean news crew could use this to quickly pull off a live on-site interview for distribution on Facebook Live or YouTube, for example. For now, the company is focusing on these two platforms, but it says that support for other content-sharing sites is “coming soon.” For now, the company is focusing on these two platforms, but it says support for other content-sharing sites is “coming soon.” The SlingStudio and its accessories will go on sale in May at B&H and directly from Sling Media.  \n",

These are the top stories of the week, and you can sign up for this post as the weekly newsletter here.  1. Everything you need to know about Facebook’s F8 developer conference Facebook held its annual developer conference, F8, announcing an augmented reality developer platform, a brain-computer interface for typing with your mind, new Surround 360 cameras and a rewrite of its React framework. Here’s the complete list of everything Facebook launched and why.  Everything Facebook launched at F8 Everything Facebook launched at F8 and why http://tcrn.ch/2pIlkPy Posted by TechCrunch on Thursday, April 20, 2017 2. Tesla’s Model S, its most affordable vehicle, got more affordable Elon Musk dropped the price on the entry-level Model S, with a $5,000 discount to the 75kWh version, which now starts at $69,500. 3. Google may be building a built-in ad blocker for Chrome Google is planning to add an ad blocker to its Chrome web browser, and could possibly turn it on by default for all users. The logic here is that although it’s odd for a company that makes its money from advertising to block ads, the move could actually be a way for Google to beat ad blockers by becoming one itself. 4. Facebook responds to murder discussed on Facebook video Facebook issued a statement after a video showing a fatal shooting was uploaded onto the social media network by an alleged murderer. In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said “This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook. We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.” 5. Tesla settles its Autopilot lawsuit Tesla settled a lawsuit it filed against Sterling Anderson, a past director of Autopilot. Anderson was a key leader of Tesla’s semi-automated highway driving features, prior to leaving the company to found his own self-driving startup, Aurora. The settlement clears Aurora and Anderson. 6. Chat app Confide hit with a lawsuit Confide, the encrypted chat app that’s reportedly popular among Trump staffers, is facing a class action lawsuit that claims the company misled consumers about its ability to protect messages from being screen-shotted or saved. 7. Juicero defends its tech while offering money back to dissatisfied customers Jeff Dunn, the former Coca-Cola executive who became CEO of Juicero last year, responded to a wave of coverage suggesting that the company’s juice press isn’t all that was promised — and he’s offering dissatisfied customers their money back.

It looks like meal kit companies need to emulate the brick-and-mortar groceries and online retailers they once criticized for overwhelming shoppers with choices.

And it isn’t over car sharing, but bike sharing. This clash is over the latest wrinkle in urban bike-sharing — dockless bike sharing.

            "279 Machine intelligence is the future of monetization for Facebook\n",
            "Money. That was effectively the only conversation missing from Facebook’s  F8 conference — an event that even made time for a progress update on a moonshot project that might one day allow us to hear through our skin. Perhaps that’s the luxury of a company whose advertising revenue is up 57 percent year-over-year. But don’t misconstrue unseen for unimportant. Behind machine intelligence “at scale” and cute Camera Effects lies a complete dependence on ad revenue. And barring a black swan event, Facebook’s expensive DARPA complex is only going to grow more dominant. One in four engineers at Facebook are active users of its internal artificial intelligence platform. In that sense, the same technology that allows you to take a selfie with a virtual flower-crown at Coachella also allows the company to identify objects within public photos and videos on your News Feed. As it becomes more difficult to cram ads onto Facebook without sacrificing the user experience, targeting, engagement and connectivity become the next natural priorities. This explains why Facebook’s ten-year roadmap highlights exactly that — connectivity to get more users on the platform and AI to boost engagement and targeting. In other words, machine intelligence is the future of monetization for Facebook. In a way, Facebook’s platform is shrinking. Just a few years ago, almost every post a user made was text. But today, an agglomeration of pictures, videos, text and live content define the platform. Without advances in computer vision and machine learning more broadly, Facebook would be handicapped by its own new features. “Content is getting more complex,” Mark Rabkin, Facebook’s VP of engineering for ads told me. But this complexity brings with it serious upside potential. It’s still very early days for understanding the human context that enables ad deliveries that lead to conversions — despite the fact that Facebook is the world’s second largest digital advertiser behind Google and the meeting room I met Rabkin in was adorned with oversized champagne bottles. Mark Rabkin, Facebook’s VP of Engineering for Ads Today, the company already knows a lot about you. Hoards of metadata and explicit groups you join, pages and posts you like, among many other things, have helped Facebook target ads as well as any company in the world. Looking at the first three ads in my News Feed right now, I see WordPress (the platform I am currently typing on), DigitalGlobe (a company I have covered) and TechCrunch (not sure why I got this one tbh). But what’s missing from this is context, or as Rabkin calls it, “the why.” While all three of those aforementioned ads are loosely relevant, I’m not really the target market for DigitalGlobe’s services, I don’t have time to keep a personal blog and if I don’t already know about what TechCrunch is advertising to me then I should be fired. “Just understanding time is huge,” added Rabkin. “We want to understand whether you’re interested in a certain thing generally or always. Certain things people do cyclically or weekly or at a specific time and it’s helpful to know how this ebbs and flows.” Facebook’s core is its internal social graph. Mining new forms of content for information that can be added to this graph, and made available across the company, opens up new possibilities for understanding user behavior. Computer vision gives computers reading glasses to interpret information from strings of images. The key to uncovering new patterns of user behavior is being able to effectively extract signal from sounds, language and images in harmony. It can help differentiate long-standing interests from mood-driven impulses. And particularly for the later, being able to perform these computations in real time is critical. Manohar Paluri and Merlyn Deng, leaders on Facebook’s applied computer vision team, have been working on this exact challenge. Their work isn’t for ads specifically, but it could soon find its way into the hands of other leaders at Facebook like Mark Rabkin and Andrew Bosworth. Manohar Paluri and Merlyn Deng, leaders on Facebook’s applied computer vision team Both Rabkin and Deng relayed the same underlying thesis to me about helping people discover content. To the Facebook ads team, discovery is critical because it not only puts the illusion of power and control in the hands of users but is already a natural task that users organically want assistance with. Of course, Facebook gets to collect a lot more information about users along the way, but conversions are generally a positive thing for everyone involved. In practice, this means that you shouldn’t expect Facebook to start the next phase of its augmented advertising journey by doing anything abrupt. It seems the company would rather you not notice its AI efforts and merely benefit passively from more holistic back-end mappings of user preferences. This differs in strategy a bit from companies like Pinterest that are building dedicated discovery tools. Instead, Facebook will go the way of Snap (yet again) and work to index its content more thoroughly. Snapchat Stories Search uses computer vision and other metadata to index stories for search in near real time — although to be fair the idea itself is a completely obvious next step for any social network driving revenue growth with ads. Once you’re able to index videos, pictures and live content in the same way as text, that “why” question that Rabkin hinted at starts to become answerable. Facebook isn’t new to qualitative research. It notoriously worked side-by-side with researchers from Cornell and the University of California–San Francisco to explore the spread of emotional contagion through social networks — think feed manipulating to see what happens when someone sees depressing posts all day. But from an ads perspective, Facebook might be able to answer hypothetical questions about why more women than men finish a video ad and why more men actually engaged with it. Facebook would only grow more powerful, in control of valuable brand insights and best practices. Facebook has executed many times over in applying machine learning to deliver engaging content. Its understanding of faces helped power features like Memories that drive shares. And its automatic video captioning feature increased video watch times by 12 percent. The value that can be extracted from the core Facebook platform is asymptotic as many on Wall Street believe, but that asymptote becomes considerably longer with the company’s emphasis on machine intelligence.  \n",

            "280 Talking fiber, drones and open-source hardware with Facebook’s Yael Maguire\n",
            "Facebook  has been putting a lot of resources into improving internet connectivity in rural areas. At first, that may seem like a distraction for the social networking giant, but Facebook takes its mission to connect people pretty literally. And to do so, it’s taking a building-block approach that involves lots of different projects that all attempt to solve different issues of this larger technology challenge. At its F8 conference in San Jose this week, Facebook once again moved these connectivity efforts into the spotlight. While the most exciting example of its work in this area is surely its giant, solar-powered Aquila drone (which actually hangs over the exhibit area at the conference), a lot of the work Facebook is doing here is in the networking technologies that connect the drone (or multiple drones) with the internet. That includes a project like Terragraph, which is meant for urban environments, as well as the likes of the OpenCellular project, a fully featured wireless access platform of technologies for improving the backhaul networks that power all of this. As Facebook’s director of its connectivity programs Yael Maguire  told me in an interview at the event, it’s worth remembering that Facebook itself has no interest in commercializing these technologies. “There is technology development and then there’s the community — how we engage with the world,” he said. “As technology gets developed, the plan is to contribute it to community organizations, the Telecom Infrastructure Project — modeled after the Open Compute project — and then figure out how we get like-minded companies and individuals excited about thinking about how technology gets deployed at scale.” He noted that a number of telecom companies are already working on prototyping some of the technologies Facebook developed and contributed, including the Voyager router project.  Facebook’s projects, of course, focus on connecting rural areas that are currently underserved by exactly the telecom companies it hopes will adopt these technologies. As Maguire noted, what these telecoms care about is that the backhaul becomes price-effective enough that it makes sense for them to provide connectivity in these areas. At the end of the day, all of these projects — no matter whether we are talking about drones or antennas that cover city blocks — depend on a backhaul network that is typically powered by fiber connections. That was also one of Facebook’s motivations for launching a rather traditional fiber network in Uganda earlier this year. “Fiber is the start of everything,” Maguire said. “You can’t have Aquila, you can’t have Terragraph unless you have fiber. And so we have to make sure that we are part of understanding and seeing if there is any way that we can help in the ecosystem context if every part of that chain of technology can work. And if Fiber is hard to deploy in rural Uganda to connect Aquila, then we have a problem.” It’s worth noting that for Facebook, the emphasis here is on connecting people — not devices. So while the projects it is working on may also be useful for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, that’s not something the company is focusing on itself. Maguire noted that the openness of the project does mean that others can take these technologies and apply them to IoT. Now that Facebook has many of the hardware building blocks in place, one of the next major set of challenges involves the software that brings it all together. “That’s actually where we are really excited because that really plays to the core strengths of the company,” Maguire told me. “We started as a software company. We’ve gotten really good at combining software and hardware for our infrastructure and that was about taking a lot of things that were commodity hardware and bringing them together in unique ways. So this idea of taking building blocks and combining them is not foreign to us.” Facebook, of course, isn’t the only company working on solving this issue of bringing connectivity to rural areas. When I asked Maguire about Google’s project Loon, which uses balloons instead of drones, he noted that his team is cheering for Google to succeed, too. “Connecting people just helps everyone, I think,” he said. “I love that they are exploring different spaces than we are.” Maguire, however, also noted that his team didn’t choose the balloon approach for a reason. “We want to focus on systems that can station-keep,” he said. “If you are connected to this network, we want to make sure that you have connectivity at all times. If the wind is blowing, it has to be there. […] At low altitude, we want systems to be tethered and we want to make it so that there is propulsion so that in the face of winds they stay stationary to provide that connectivity.”  \n",

            "Facebook’s  augmented reality future may be taking the form of selfie filters today, but in the future, the company wants to let you interact with the world only by using your brain. Regina Dugan, who leads Facebook’s Building 8 group, gave a remarkable marketing spiel on the company’s efforts in shaping the future of human-computer interaction and imagining a future where you can control AR glasses with the brain. During the F8 keynote, she urged the audience to imagine: “What if you could type with your brain?” Details were relatively scant as to what this would really look like, though a Stanford University experiment Dugan referenced relied on “an array of electrodes the size of a pea” implanted inside the subject’s brain. This obviously initially sounds pretty horrifying for a company that has had such an issue with privacy issues; Dugan made efforts to allay future fears by saying that these devices couldn’t read your silent thoughts, but instead allowed you to control a “brain mouse” that would one day allow you to type up to 100 words per minute. Dugan says that “no one has the right” to decode your silent thoughts, but the fact that’s even something that has to be said says something scary about where technology is headed. Oculus has already dealt with some blowback for its Terms and Conditions, which give Facebook access to your movements and where you’re looking in VR, what these scandals look like in the future could be even more invasive. The team at Building 8 has around 60 scientists working across disciplines to research this technology. There is an awful lot of hype in this space at the moment, despite the fact that most see the tech as decades down the road. It was recently reported that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is starting a similar brain interface startup called Neuralink focused, for now, on developing the capabilities of the brain. When is this pipe dream going to be a reality? Understandably there’s not a launch date in site, but Dugan says the company hopes to show off a system in “a few years time.”  \n",

            "283 Facebook is building brain-computer interfaces for typing and skin-hearing\n",
            "Today at F8, Facebook  revealed it has a team of 60 engineers working on building a brain-computer interface that will let you type with just your mind without invasive implants. The team plans to use optical imaging to scan your brain a hundred times per second to detect you speaking silently in your head, and translate it into text. Regina Dugan, the head of Facebook’s R&D division Building 8, explained to conference attendees that the goal is to eventually allow people to type at 100 words per minute, 5X faster than typing on a phone, with just your mind. Eventually, brain-computer interfaces could let people control augmented reality and virtual reality experiences with their mind instead of a screen or controller. Facebook’s CEO and CTO teased these details of this “direct brain interface” technology over the last two days at F8. “What if you could type directly from your brain?” Dugan asked. She showed a video of a paralyzed medical patient at Stanford who can type using their mind thanks to an implanted sensor. She went on to explain how Facebook wants to do this without surgical implants. Building 8 only began working on the brain typing project six months ago, but it now is collaborating with UC San Francisco, UC Berkeley, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Researchers who specialize in machine learning for decoding speech and language, building optical neuroimaging systems with advanced spatial resolution and next-generation neural prosthetics are involved. A Stanford patient can type with their mind via a surgical implant. Facebook wants to build a faster, non-invasive version The plan is to eventually build non-implanted devices that can ship at scale. And to tamp down on the inevitable fear this research will inspire, Facebook tells me “This isn’t about decoding random thoughts. This is about decoding the words you’ve already decided to share by sending them to the speech center of your brain.” Facebook likened it to how you take lots of photos but only share some of them. Even with its device, Facebook says you’ll be able to think freely but only turn some thoughts into text. Meanwhile, Building 8 is working on a way for humans to hear through their skin. It’s been building prototypes of hardware and software that let your skin mimic the cochlea in your ear that translates sound into specific frequencies for your brain. This technology could let deaf people essentially “hear” by bypassing their ears. A team of Facebook engineers was shown experimenting with hearing through skin using a system of actuators tuned to 16 frequency bands. A test subject was able to develop a vocabulary of nine words they could hear through their skin.  To underscore the gravity of Building 8s mind-reading technology, Dugan started her talk by saying she’s never seen something as powerful as the smartphone “that didn’t have unintended consequences.” She mentioned that we’d all be better off if we looked up from our phones every so often. But at the same time, she believes technology can foster empathy, education and global community. Facebook hired Dugan last year to lead its secretive new Building 8 research lab. She had previously run Google’s Advanced Technology And Products division, and was formerly a head of DARPA. Facebook built a special Area 404 wing of its Menlo Park headquarters with tons of mechanical engineering equipment to help Dugan’s team quickly prototype new hardware. In December, it signed rapid collaboration deals with Stanford, Harvard, MIT and more to get academia’s assistance. Yet until now, nobody really knew what Building 8 was…building. Business Insider had reported on Building 8’s job listings and that it might show off news at F8. According to these job listings, Facebook is looking for a Brain-Computer Interface Engineer “who will be responsible for working on a 2-year B8 project focused on developing advanced BCI technologies.” Responsibilities include “Application of machine learning methods, including encoding and decoding models, to neuroimaging and electrophysiological data.” It’s also looking for a Neural Imaging Engineer who will be “focused on developing novel non-invasive neuroimaging technologies” who will “Design and evaluate novel neural imaging methods based on optical, RF, ultrasound, or other entirely non-invasive approaches.” Elon Musk has been developing his own startup called Neuralink for creating brain interfaces. Facebook Building 8 R&D division head Regina Dugan   Facebook has built hardware before to mixed success. It made an Android phone with HTC called the First to host its Facebook Home operating system. That flopped. Since then, Facebook proper has turned its attention away from consumer gadgetry and toward connectivity. It’s built the Terragraph Wi-Fi nodes, Project ARIES antenna, Aquila solar-powered drone and its own connectivity-beaming satellite from its internet access initiative — though that blew up on the launch pad when the SpaceX vehicle carrying it exploded. Facebook has built and open sourced its Surround 360 camera. As for back-end infrastructure, it’s developed an open-rack network switch called Wedge, the Open Vault for storage, plus sensors for the Telecom Infra Project’s OpenCellular platform. And finally, through its acquisition of Oculus, Facebook has built wired and mobile virtual reality headsets. Facebook’s Area 404 hardware lab contains tons of mechanical engineering and prototyping equipment But as Facebook grows, it has the resources and talent to try new approaches in hardware. With over 1.8 billion users connected to just its main Facebook app, the company has a massive funnel of potential guinea pigs for its experiments. Today’s announcements are naturally unsettling. Hearing about a tiny startup developing these advanced technologies might have conjured images of governments or coporate conglomerates one day reading our mind to detect thought crime, like in 1984. Facebook’s scale makes that future feel more plausible, no matter how much Zuckerberg and Dugan try to position the company as benevolent and compassionate. The more Facebook can do to institute safe-guards, independent monitoring, and transparency around how brain-interface technology is built and tested, the more receptive it might find the public.  A week ago Facebook was being criticized as nothing but a Snapchat copycat that had stopped innovating. Today’s demos seemed design to dismantle that argument and keep top engineering talent knocking on its door. “Do you want to work for the company who pioneered putting augmented reality dog ears on teens, or the one that pioneered typing with telepathy?” You don’t have to say anything. For Facebook, thinking might be enough.  \n",

            "284 Facebook is improving the 360 video experience by predicting where you will look\n",
            "From the stage of F8, Joaquin Quinonero, Facebook’s  Director of Applied Machine Learning, described a new technique the company is using to improve the watching experience for 360 videos. The format is challenging to deliver because of its size, but Facebook is using machine learning to reduce the number of pixels that have to be rendered at any one time. By predicting where a viewer will look next, rendering priority can be given to that location  — particularly helpful for users with lower quality internet access. The status quo for 360 videos is reactive rather than proactive rendering. Mike Coward, engineering director for Facebook’s VR video team echoed the frustration of users to me when he described the unpleasantness of turning your head in VR only to see a blurry scene. One partial fix is to optimize compression. But teams at the company are already using machine learning to select across the thousand-plus compression techniques for individual snippets of video. The other way to reduce the streaming load is to just cut down on what you’re rendering. And rather than reduce quality across the board, Facebook’s approach improves resolution for exactly what you’re most likely to look at next. Mike Coward, engineering director for Facebook’s VR video team Step one was to use the resources of the company to monitor where people actually do look when watching 360 videos. Facebook’s VR video team created a heat-map that highlighted the most popular spots that users looked at within videos. From there, Facebook built a generative saliency map using a deep neural network. This model makes it possible to perform predictions on new videos that haven’t previously been watched or studied. If a human were to be given the task of predicting where someone might look, they might study their natural environment and look for anomalies that could catch one’s interest — think birds or a car driving by. Abstracting away to the neural net, the physical cars and birds cease to matter. Facebook’s model was trained on a massive corpus of videos to identify interesting subsets of a video frame. Coward told me that the model, when faced with a surfer in the ocean, is capable of picking selecting the surfer as most interesting, despite the fact that both are fast moving entities. After implementing the prediction model, Facebook was able to increase resolution by 39 percent on VR devices. Aside from improving resolution and making 360 videos accessible to people without great network connections, the technology could some day make it possible to offer preemptive suggestions to creators on how to make videos more engaging.  \n",

            "285 Facebook will license its new 360 cameras that capture in six degrees of freedom\n",
            "On day two of Facebook’s  F8 conference, Facebook’s CTO Mike Schroepfer showed off designs for two new 360 cameras that the company is going to help push to market. The x24, with 24 cameras, and its little brother the x6, with six cameras, can each capture in six degrees of freedom for more immersive 360 content. Facebook plans to license the designs of the two cameras to select commercial partners to get each to market later this year. Prototyped in Facebook’s Area 404, the x24 combines the FLIR camera system with Facebook’s proprietary architecture. Being able to shoot in six degrees of freedom (6DoF) cuts out a lot of the work that would traditionally be required to create 360 videos where the watcher can tilt their head in all directions without sacrificing the believability of a given shot.  The conceptual idea, sometimes referred to as volumetric capture, has been heralded for some time as a major milestone for VR. Startups like Lytro have been betting on light fields to get the job done, while 8i has taken a software approach. Instead, Facebook is taking a sparse lens orientation approach that avoids the complex rigs all-together. “Unfortunately, capturing full 6-DoF 360 videos requires more complex hardware setups like camera arrays or light-field cameras that are not affordable and easy to use for novice users,” a team of Adobe researchers said in a recent paper on the subject. The benefit of capturing depth information at the pixel level is that it enables fun post-production video masking where a creator could swap out mountains in the background of a video for a beach instead.  These new cameras, building on the original Surround 360, also look fantastic. The old Surround seemed to draw inspiration from the spinning top at the end of Inception, but the x24 and x6’s smaller, simple spherical design is exactly the familiar and welcoming look you want from futuristic technology. “Part of what we are doing with the ecosystem, and the camera itself, is giving these tools to content creators so they can start to develop this artistic language,” explained Brian Cabral, Facebook’s director of engineering. Bootstrapping a community is hard work, but Facebook realizes that the success of everything, from News Feed 360 videos to the Oculus itself, depends on an ecosystem of content creators. To this avail, Facebook is partnering with post-production companies and VFX houses, including Adobe, Otoy, Foundry, Mettle, DXO, Here Be Dragons, Framestore, Magnopus and The Mill.  \n",

            "286 Facebook’s millimeter-wave radio tech hits new bandwidth records\n",
            "It’s no secret that Facebook  is highly interested in bringing internet connectivity to more people — even in very remote areas where traditional technologies don’t typically work. To do this, the company has recently focused on its Aquila drone and many of the back-end radio technologies that are necessary for bringing wireless access to more users. Today, at its F8 developer conference, the company provided an update on the state of many of these projects. The highlight here is probably the fact that Facebook’s millimeter-wave (MMW) radio technology, which can be used for drone-to-ground communications or for more traditional terrestrial applications, keeps getting better. Last year, the team was able to set up channels with data rates of up to 20 Gbps over about eight miles. That’s a lot of bandwidth, but as the company announced today, its MMW technology has now hit 80 Gbps. More impressively, it’s also been able to establish a 16 Gbps link between a ground station and a small plane that was circling almost five miles away. That’s the first time Facebook has demonstrated that it can use this technology for its drone project, too, where it can be used as a backup to the optical system the company is developing simultaneously (which doesn’t work so well when it’s cloudy and foggy).  As Facebook’s director of its connectivity programs Yael Maguire writes in today’s announcement, this technology is part of what he describes as a “building block strategy.” The reason for this, he writes, is that there is no silver bullet for providing connectivity everywhere and that it will take the interplay of many technologies. “Rather than look for a one-size-fits-all solution, we are investing in a building block strategy — designing different technologies for specific use cases which are then used together with partners to create flexible and extensible networks,” Maguire writes.  In addition to these projects, Facebook also today announced that it is working on a tethered drone system that can hook into fiber lines, take off and then provide wireless connectivity from there. During his F8 keynote, Maguire noted that the company is working on this in order to provide connectivity during emergencies. Details about the project, however, remain sparse, though we expect Facebook will provide more information in the near future.   \n",

            "287 Facebook open sources Caffe2, its flexible deep learning framework of choice\n",
            "Today Facebook open sourced Caffe2. The deep learning framework follows in the steps of the original Caffe, a project started at the University of California, Berkeley. Caffe2 offers developers greater flexibility for building high-performance products that deploy efficiently. This isn’t the first time that Facebook has engaged with the Caffe community. Back in October, Facebook announced Caffe2Go, what effectively was a mobile CPU and GPU optimized version of Caffe2 (they even both have Caffe2 in their names if you parse it right). Caffe2Go received attention at that time because its release coincided with Style Transfer. Notably, the company also released extensions to the original Caffe. The majority of these changes make Caffe more attractive to developers building services for large audiences. For projects where resources are of no consequence, Facebook has historically turned to Torch — a library it finds optimal for research use cases. Every tech company wants to tout the scalability of its machine learning framework of choice. I asked Yangqing Jia, the lead author on Caffe2, what he thought of MXNet and the noise Amazon has been making about its ability to scale. Reasonably, he was cautious about dropping benchmarking numbers for comparison. These numbers can have meaning, but they are heavily influenced by the actual implementation of a machine learning model and subject to a fair amount of “DIY” volatility. Yangqing Jia, the lead author on Caffe2 and Alex Yu, leader of business development “All frameworks are more or less at a similar scalability factor,” explained Jia. “We’re pretty confident that Caffe2 is probably a little bit better than the rest.” Facebook is pouring a lot of resources into both Caffe2 and PyTorch. Today’s release accompanies partnerships at the hardware, device and cloud levels. Alex Yu, leader of business development for Caffe2, explained to me that Facebook aimed to include the market leaders in each category. This meant Nvidia and Intel on the hardware side, Qualcomm on the device side and Amazon and Microsoft on the cloud side. And while Google wasn’t targeted, a GCP partnership wouldn’t be out of the question going forward. Prior to release, Caffe2 was deployed at scale across Facebook. The team also took considerations for the developer communities familiar with the original Caffe. Caffe models can be easily converted to Caffe2 models with a utility script. Facebook is releasing documentation and tutorials and has put Caffe2’s source code on GitHub.  \n",

            "288 Facebook expands its open-source portfolio with new UI framework for Android\n",
            "At its F8 developer conference, Facebook today announced that it is open-sourcing Litho, a declarative framework for building efficient user interfaces on Android. Litho is the same framework Facebook uses internally to build its own Android app, which is currently being used by more than a billion people every month. The company first talked about this new framework last October. At the time, the company noted that the issue it was trying to solve was mostly about building a more performant framework for displaying the Facebook News Feed, which tends to be more complex than the scrollable lists for which the standard Android tools are optimized. Those lists tend to use Android’s RecyclerView, but in order to get to the 60 frames per second that modern device screens now typically support (and which users expect), the RecyclerView simply isn’t fast enough for more complex applications.  “As UIs become increasingly sophisticated, it gets harder to complete all the rendering work that needs to get done in this time frame,” Facebook’s Pasquale Anatriello and Marco Cova write in today’s announcement. “This proves to be especially challenging with dynamic scrolling surfaces, as new pieces of UI are constantly being introduced on screen.” Litho’s programmers used some of what Facebook learned from React  and built a new system that improves scroll performance up to 35 percent. It does that, in part, by breaking down complex views like the News Feed into smaller components (think text, images and videos) that can then be rendered incrementally. It also can take some of those smaller pieces and recycle them without having to keep multiple copies in memory.  As Facebook engineering manager Lucas Rocha and Facebook engineer Emil Sjolander told me earlier this week, it’s worth noting that while this focus on feeds may solve Facebook’s problems (but isn’t really applicable to other apps), many of the most popular apps today are indeed built around the idea of a feed. Now that it’s open source, other developers outside of Facebook may also be able to implement some of the idea here for other problems, but the team itself is mostly focused on optimizing the product for the use cases Facebook itself sees. Litho is now available on GitHub. Facebook is also making a number of tutorials and technical deep dives available on the project’s homepage.  \n",

            "289 Facebook launches React VR, a new JavaScript framework for building basic VR apps\n",
            "At its F8 developer conference, Facebook today announced the launch of React VR, a new JavaScript framework that lets developers build virtual reality experiences with the help of JavaScript. As its name implies, React  VR takes its cues from Facebook’s existing React framework; just like with React for standard web apps, VR developers can now use the same declarative model to write apps for their 360-degree experiences. Unsurprisingly, React VR uses existing web technologies like WebGL and WebVR to power the experience and interact with the various sensors in them. It’s worth noting that the focus here isn’t (yet?) on building complex VR games and other experiences. While you can add 3D models, the main idea here is to allow developers to easily combine 360 panoramas with 2D user interfaces, text and images. Anybody with experience in building React apps should be able to build React VR apps pretty easily (and those developers will also be able to leverage many of the existing tools in the React ecosystem). Even more so than mobile apps, VR apps need to be rendered at 60 frames per second (or, ideally, even faster). Because React Native already addressed many of the issues that typically make this hard to do with a JavaScript app, the team was able to get the right amount of performance to make React VR applications fast enough, too. The code of React VR is now available on GitHub and, if you want to play with it, you also can find the documentation here.  \n",

            "290 Facebook announces React Fiber, a rewrite of its React framework\n",
            "Facebook has completely rewritten React, its popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The company hasn’t previously talked much about React  Fiber, as the project is called, but it has actually been working on it for a while. It’s now ready to talk about this project publicly in more detail (after word about it started spreading last year) and the plan is to put this rewrite into the hands of developers once React 16.0 launches later this year. It’s already in use on Facebook.com today, which clearly indicates that Facebook itself thinks it’s ready for prime time. In addition, it is also launching a rewrite of Relay, its framework for building data-heavy applications. The idea behind React Fiber, the company tells me, is to take what the company has learned from developing React the first time around and put that into an updated framework that is still fully backwards compatible with existing React-based applications. React Fiber, Facebook tells me, will become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React framework. The main focus here was to make React as responsive as possible, Facebook engineer — and member of the React core team — Ben Alpert told me in an interview earlier this week. “When we develop React, we’re always looking to see how we can help developers build high-quality apps quicker,” he noted. “We want to make it easier to make apps that perform very well and make them responsive.” In light of this theme, it’s no surprise that the highlights of this new release are built-in primitives for scheduling and incremental rendering. “We want to make sure we render the right stuff at the right time,” Alpert said, and added that “responsiveness was a huge push here.” But why rewrite React from scratch? “It was not necessarily that the old code base was bad, but we wanted to start with a new foundation that could power everything we do going forward,” Alpert said. That means the new code was developed from the ground up to be extensible, for example. Alpert stressed that React Fiber will be backward compatible, though as with all major React updates, there will be a few small breaking changes. The team says it doesn’t anticipate that these will be problematic for developers, though. “We always had a strong API contract, so that gives us the flexibility to reimplement,” he added. As Facebook also today announced, Relay — the company’s JavaScript framework for building data-driven applications — has also been rewritten with a similar emphasis on performance and extensibility. Relay combines React with Facebook’s GraphQL query language and now Relay Modern, as the company calls this rewrite, is meant to push this concept further and overcome some of the limitations of the original design. That also meant simplifying some of the design to enhance the overall performance of the framework. “Relay Modern retains the best parts of Relay — colocated data and view definitions, declarative data fetching — while also simplifying the API, adding features, improving performance, and reducing the size of the framework,” the team explains in today’s announcement. To do this, the team implemented a number of changes, but most importantly, it adopted static queries and ahead-of-time optimizations. Static queries essentially ensure that complex queries that aren’t altered by runtime conditions can be pre-built and offloaded to Facebook’s servers. So instead of sending complex queries across the network, all an application has to send is a string that identifies the pre-set query and the variables needed to complete it. Related to this, the ahead-of-time optimization feature in the Relay compiler now looks at the query structure to optimize the query that is now stored on the server to execute it faster — and hence return results to the user faster, too. Other new features in React Modern include built-in garbage collection, for example. For developers who are already using an older version of Relay, Relay Modern comes with a compatibility API. Facebook says that when its teams switched the Marketplace tab in the Facebook app from Relay to Relay Modern, the time to interaction on Android improved by an average of 900ms. While that doesn’t sound like much, every second on mobile counts, and that’s enough to make an application feel noticeably more responsive than before.  \n",

            "Facebook  is launching a couple of new features for its Messenger platform today. Among those is an update to its M virtual assistant, which can now help you order food through delivery.com, the launch of Messenger Codes, which are basically QR codes you can scan into Messenger, and better support for Game bots and turn-by-turn games. The M virtual assistant added support for suggestions earlier this year, but with this update, it can now recognize when you are talking to your friends about getting dinner and suggest placing an order with delivery.com. That experience, Facebook says, includes group ordering and payment, too. This new feature is now available everywhere in the U.S. served by delivery.com.  Facebook Messenger is also getting a Game tab (which is rolling out today). This tab will now also get access to Game bots and Rich Gameplay (that is, turn-by-turn games). In total, more than 1.5 billion games have been played in Messenger over the last 90 days, Facebook says. As for the QR codes, the experience is pretty much what you’d expect. You will be able to scan these QR codes at concerts, basketball games or other events and, after you’ve scanned them, a Messenger bot will pop up to provide you with more information. While QR codes never quite caught on (at least in the U.S.), which Facebook freely admits, this does look like an interesting way of using them and may just make them a tiny bit more popular.  For businesses, Facebook is obviously also launching tools to generate these codes. These businesses can now also work with different developers to provide different Messenger experiences. That means a business can have both a shopping and customer service bot, for example, and different vendors and developers can manage these separately. On their Facebook Pages, these businesses now also get support for smart replies, which are powered by the Wit.ai bot engine. Through them, they can respond to frequently asked questions that customers regularly ask them (think business hours, directions, phone numbers, etc.). In addition to all of this, Facebook also today announced major updates to its group bots and it’s making bot discovery, easier too.   \n",

            "Facebook’s VP of Partnerships, Ime Archibong, announced updates to Facebook Analytics as well as Facebook Login and Account Kit during his F8 keynote address. Analytics is getting greater customizability and a machine learning boost while Login and Account Kit are benefiting from additional transparency and accessibility. Facebook analytics is a core product for businesses using the platform to drive growth. Today’s updates make it simultaneously easier to regularly monitor important metrics while increasing the value of individual insights. To this end, new custom dashboards put important reports on a single screen and enable users to put what’s important to them front and center. But to actually provide deeper analysis, Facebook is integrating machine learning into its analytics platform. This opens up new possibilities for monitoring engagement and purchasing behavior in a relatively granular way. The tool can surface trends and present them to users in a ranked feed. The company is also closing the gap between what happens in the world of social and what happens on brand websites and in brick and mortar stores. Businesses can now relate Page activity to purchases that occur on their websites. Omni-channel analytics also support offline conversions. To help organize customers across channels, Facebook is allowing for custom audience groupings and deeper user segmentation as part of a beta. From within Facebook Analytics, users also can monitor Account Kit traffic. The tool makes it easy for users to log in to other apps and services, password free. Brands will further benefit from the ability to customize the design of the Account Kit login interface with company colors and relevant background images. To maximize the audience that can benefit from Account Kit, Facebook is adding voice call support in 19 new regions. This offers an option other than SMS for users that might be unable to, or not want to, use text for verification. These same users will benefit from a new basic web SDK that opens up the swifter login experience to users facing low connectivity. Finally, all businesses can now implement account recovery using Facebook as an alternative to existing, clunky, password reset processes.  \n",

            "293 Facebook Messenger launches group bots and bot discovery tab\n",
            "Facebook  today launched two powerful ways for people to find Messenger bots to use, addressing the discovery problem that’s plagued the platform’s 100,000 developers. Facebook’s new Chat Extensions lets you use Messenger bots in group chats so you can watch a sports game’s play-by-play together from theScore’s news ticker bot, collaborate on building a Spotify playlist, figure out which hotel you want to stay at with friends and book it via SnapTravel or get a consensus on booking a flight through Kayak. OpenTable, the NBA, Food Network, WSJ and other developers are also launching group bots today. Apple Music is coming soon.  TechCrunch reported last month that Facebook would launch these group bots today at F8. Until now, bot experiences were just you and the bot. But that puts a ton of pressure on the bot to seem human. Chat Extensions pose them more as assistants or tickers rather than conversation partners, better matching what’s feasible with today’s technology.  The second big piece of bot discovery news is the launch of a Discovery tab on Messenger, where people can see their recently used bots, browse bot categories, see trending experiences or search for specific bots. Users will be able to check out a preview screen about what a bot does before starting a conversation with one. Developers need to submit a form with this preview information to be included in the curated tab.  Finally, Facebook is expanding its M Suggestions feature that uses AI to scan your conversations and recommend Messenger features to use. M will now start to suggest bots from outside developers that could serve a need that users are talking about. For example, if someone says “we should order food,” M could recommend delivery.com’s bot for making an order. Together, these could give bots on Messenger more traction through virality in groups and merit via Facebook’s choices of what’s best. That could attract more prestigious developers to the platform. Facebook launched Messenger bots last year, but users had a tough time finding good ones; many bots disappointed people because they relied on inadequate AI, or they were confusing to use. Onstage today at Facebook’s F8 conference, Messenger head David Marcus said “I’m glad we called it a beta.” Facebook has been trying to improve bots with the option to navigate via menus instead of text commands. And at F8, Messenger also launched QR codes for the physical world that open a specific experience inside a bot, as well as more features to help businesses. Meanwhile, bots like SnapTravel, which has done $1 million-worth of hotel bookings inside Messenger, prove that in-chat commerce is starting to work. With today’s updates, bot developers will have good reason to fight through the churn rates and lack of user understanding. With 1.2 billion users on Messenger, there are plenty of people who could try their bots.  \n",

            "294 Workplace by Facebook continues to mature\n",
            "At the F8 conference today, Facebook announced a bunch of updates to its Workplace by Facebook  team communications tool, including a slew of new partnerships and new bot integrations, which all show a product that’s maturing to meet the needs of larger enterprise customers. When Workplace by Facebook launched last fall, it was an attempt to take Facebook and put it into a business context. But working with businesses has a different set of requirements than consumers, and that means working with third-party business software in a seamless way. It’s certainly something that one of the company’s chief rivals in this space, Slack, has recognized and built into its product from the earliest days. Today’s updates are about bringing that same type of integration, including file sharing, bots and compliance and governance tools, into the Workplace by Facebook experience. This kind of blending has been on the drawing board from the beginning, according to Julien Codorniou, vice president of Workplace. “Being the communication layer and discovery platform for other services has always been part of the plan,” he told TechCrunch. “Workplace wants to be the app that connects everyone,” he added. For starters, the company announced integrations with Box, Microsoft, Dropbox and Quip/Salesforce. That means when you share a file in a Facebook group, instead of just a link, you’ll see a thumbnail and when you click it, you go directly to the file for editing or commenting. Photo: Facebook Bret Taylor, CEO and co-founder at Quip, a productivity software company that Salesforce bought last summer for $750 million, says that these kinds of integrations are becoming increasingly important to businesses. “One of the issues of modern cloud software is the explosion of services in a company. It is exacerbating [the problem of] where does data live and how do I interact with it. The vision is that [these services] can seamlessly interoperate and you don’t have jump back and forth to get the job done,” Taylor explained. This isn’t exclusive to Workplace, and Taylor acknowledged Salesforce/Quip had similar connections in competing products, but as they are seeing customers using Workplace, they feel they need to be there too. “At the end of the day, if you don’t integrate with the tools your customer use, you’re going to lose a customer,” he said. The company is also introducing bots into the Workplace experience in both Messenger and Group chat, which puts it on par with what Slack has been doing for some time. These bots are powerful entities, which you can call upon to help out. For instance, if there is an equipment problem, you could call on @repairbot to find someone to fix it. The bot can acknowledge your request, locate an available person to undertake the repair and message back the name of the person taking care of it. This ability to read messages, take actions and send messages is a powerful mix and can allow bots to take care of mundane tasks more quickly than human counterparts. These bots can work in Messenger in a one to one chat environment or Groups in a group chat. Photo: Facebook “The reason why we are so excited about custom bots is that we have over 100 bots at Facebook to power everyday experiences,” Codorniou said. The company is working with a number of bot platforms, including Converse, PullString, The Bot Platform, kore.ai and Avaamo. One of the big issues facing a company like Facebook as it makes its way into the enterprise is finding ways to link to compliance and governance systems already in place in the company. Without this, it’s awfully tough to gain the trust of IT and security professionals inside large organizations, who might have been conditioned not to trust the Facebook consumer tool. Facebook seems to have recognized this, but rather than trying to build compliance and governance into the tool itself, it has chosen to partner with some companies that have expertise in the field, which is probably a smart way to go about it. Those same IT pros, who might not trust this type of tool for starters, will probably be more comfortable with some known entities, rather than something Facebook built itself, at least initially. Compliance partners include CSDisco, Netskope, Smarsh and Skyhigh. Although it was launched just last October, Facebook reports 14,000 organizations using the tool, which have created more than 400,000 groups. As a means of comparison, Slack reports 5 million daily active users. All of these announcements have been designed to make it easier for Workplace to be an integral part of the company experience and to compete to get a piece of that communications business, but it’s also a tacit recognition that it needs to provide a tool set, partnerships and integrations that enterprise customers are going to demand.  \n",

            "Facebook’s been steadily growing its Developer Circles initiative in recent months and today during its annual F8 conference the company provided an update on growth and announced a new partnership with Udacity. Developer Circles is Facebook’s community-driven initiative for engaging with and training developers. Facebook’s VP of Partnerships, Ime Archibong, explained that more than 80 percent of engineers involved with Developer Circles are based internationally. This growth is healthy, but it’s not without its own unique logistical challenges. As of now, community leaders within Developer Circles help organize training, but with a new Udacity  partnership, Facebook will be augmenting learning with formalized programs. These new mobile developer courses will help get engineers-in-training up to speed on Facebook tools like Account Kit for building one-step logins into apps. Udacity says the courses will be free and require about 10 hours each to complete. Topics could eventually cover the basics of using React and building bots in Messenger. The courses will be available within Developer Circles Facebook Groups and through the Udacity site. This is not Udacity’s first partnership with a major tech company to produce content. Back at Google I/O in 2015, Udacity announced it was working to create an Android Development Nanodegree.   \n",

            "296 Facebook expands delegated account recovery in a play for the next billion users\n",
            "Facebook  is expanding a new account recovery tool it debuted in January that allows other sites such as GitHub to establish encrypted account recovery tokens that are stored by Facebook. When a user loses their GitHub password and gets locked out of their account, he sends the recovery token from Facebook back to GitHub, proving his identity. It’s a slick security feature that will be an easy sell for privacy pros, but it’s also a crucial component of Facebook’s strategy to make sure the next billion internet users center their online experiences around Facebook. At the F8 developer conference today, Facebook is releasing SDKs and documentation that will allow developers aside from GitHub to set up Delegated Account Recovery for their own test users. Once the setup is in place, developers can apply to Facebook’s beta program and start making the feature available to their users. Delegated Account Recovery is designed to make account recovery more secure. If you’ve ever forgotten a password (and who hasn’t?) you know the recovery process usually involves a link sent to your email or a security code texted to your phone. But email can easily be compromised if a user’s password has been included in a data breach or if they’ve fallen for a phishing scheme, and texted security codes can get lost in transmission if you’ve upgraded to a new phone or changed your number. “The system is designed to be resilient even to large scale data dumps of email and user databases that have become too common. With independently held cryptographic keys needed to use them, recovery tokens offer a level of security that we don’t see from email,” Facebook security engineer Brad Hill explained in a blog post. Here’s how the recovery flow works:  But even if the highest level of account security isn’t a selling point for some users, Hill gave me a succinct and compelling pitch for why Delegated Account Recovery is better than other methods when he debuted the feature back in January: “We can get you back into your account even if you drop your phone off the boat.” Facebook launched the feature with GitHub, whose users are inclined to be more technical and can more easily navigate the set-up process. Now that Facebook is expanding Delegated Account Recovery to other sites, it will need to sell developers on the idea that the extra set-up hurdles — and the association with Facebook — is worth the switch from email. Some online retailers might be quick to adopt Delegated Account Recovery, but it’s easy to imagine Amazon, Google or Twitter being resistant to the idea. That’s part of why the project is open source: other companies could establish themselves as identity hubs, too. “Eliminating fraud is a shared goal, not a competitive space,” Hill said. “Having multiple providers will be helpful to this ecosystem.” If the ecosystem grows, security could expand too. Users could store recovery tokens for encrypted data across several different sites, so a user would need to prove access to multiple accounts in order to decrypt the data. Getting other companies to participate, either by storing recovery tokens with Facebook or issuing tokens themselves, will help Facebook grow outside the U.S. and Europe, where email recovery is already uncommon. “Facebook user surveys are revealing a decline in the use of personal email and a growing preference for phone number as an account identifier. In some parts of Africa and the Asia Pacific region, the preference for phone number over email is as high as 70%,” Hill explained. “And in many of those same places where phone number is most popular, it is also a very unstable identifier. People often have multiple SIMs cards, switch numbers frequently to get a better deal, and treat phone numbers as spam collection accounts like people in English-speaking markets often do with email.” Because users in these markets are abandoning email in exchange for phone numbers as their primary identity hub, Facebook needs to follow that trend. Establishing itself as the keyholder for users’ online identities gives Facebook continuity, even as its users abandon SIM cards or change email addresses. Like Internet.org, Facebook’s program to provide free access to some internet services, Delegated Account Recovery could make Facebook a foundational part of the online experience for the next billion users. “If you depend on email for recovery, you’re going to miss connecting with a lot of people. And, if you are signing people up to your service with a phone number, it is critical you have a way to recover when that number changes,” Hill added. If Facebook can instigate wide adoption of Delegated Account Recovery, it will be a win for user security inside and outside of Facebook, as well as for the company’s expansion plans. Now that the feature is open to developers outside GitHub, we’ll see how widely it will be adopted.  \n",

            "297 Facebook launches beta of Spaces, its goofy and fun social VR platform\n",
            "More than three years after its acquisition of Oculus, Facebook  is a product even more deeply intertwined with people’s online identities. Today, Facebook is reaching an important milestone as it launches the first significant integration of social virtual reality into its core product. Facebook Spaces launches in beta today on Oculus Rift + Touch. The product is a first taste of Facebook’s ambitions to bring social interaction into 3D virtual spaces. With Spaces, those who have bought into the Oculus ecosystem can connect their Facebook accounts and dive into an environment where communication isn’t about chat messages, but voice and avatar body language.  In the app, up to four friends logged-in to their Facebook accounts can join a “space” and chat, draw, watch 360 videos, make video calls on Messenger and take VR selfies of their cartoonish avatars (which it can create for you based on recently tagged photos). It’s all pretty basic stuff focused around having fun at the moment; everything feels quite a bit more light-hearted than the cold, bulky Oculus hardware you’re using to experience Spaces. I had a chance to dive into Spaces for an early demo and it’s clear that Facebook is building this for the masses, even though the masses don’t own a Rift right now. The space is quirky, fun and not taking itself too seriously. https://twitter.com/Lucas_Matney/status/854392996690706432 The most noteworthy highlight of Spaces’ release is that it will be launching on the Oculus Rift but will soon be expanding to other VR platforms. “We eventually want to be on all the VR platforms,” Facebook product manager Mike Booth told me. What’s key about this is that Facebook — despite owning a popular VR hardware platform — wants to be a Google in the VR space, not an Apple. Don’t expect Spaces to be available on the smartphone-based VR systems that you see today. Samsung and Oculus’ Gear VR platform relies on 360 fixed-point movement, which doesn’t lend itself well to expressing yourself in VR. For the Gear VR, Facebook has shown off Facebook 360, an app for viewing 360 photos and videos. Spaces represents the first .1 percent of Facebook’s vision for Social VR according to Booth, but it’s clear that the app represents a lot of calculation on Facebook’s part. In a recent earnings call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called virtual reality something that won’t see its full potential realized for another 10 years. Currently, there are between 30-50 Facebook employees working on Social VR, but with augmented reality and virtual reality growing central to Facebook’s core product, these teams are sure to grow massive as more people buy headsets. Augmented reality may be the key to Facebook dominating the next decade of mobile, but Facebook is building something incredibly forward-thinking as it rethinks how people experience deeply human emotions in virtual reality. Spaces is just a first step, but it’s an important one. Spaces is available now  for free download in the Early Access section of the Oculus Store.  \n",

            "298 Facebook launches augmented reality Camera Effects developer platform\n",
            "Facebook  will rely on an army of outside developers to contribute augmented reality image filters and interactive experiences to its new Camera Effects platform. After today’s Facebook F8 conference, the first effects will become available inside Facebook’s Camera feature on smartphones, but the Camera Effects platform is designed to eventually be compatible with future augmented reality hardware, such as eyeglasses. While critics thought Facebook was just mindlessly copying Snapchat with its recent Stories and Camera features in Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, Mark Zuckerberg tells TechCrunch his company was just laying the groundwork for today’s Camera Effects platform launch.  Facebook’s Camera Effects Platform offers object recognition Because stylish, affordable AR glasses might be years away but everyone already has a camera phone, Zuckerberg tells me “the first augmented reality platform that becomes mainstream isn’t going to be glasses, it’s going to be cameras.” He says other apps (like Snapchat) have been keeping their augmented reality experience creation tools to themselves, but “building an open platform I think is going to be one of the big advances that pushes this forward . . . all developers can work on [the open platform] so that way you don’t just have 10 or 20 effects but you have thousands.” That’s the same logic behind my August thought piece on why the camera should be Facebook’s next platform, which it now is. Developers let Facebook offer a much wider diversity of experiences. Facebook is now allowing developers to apply for access to the closed beta of the platform’s AR Studio tool. It will allow developers to use precise location, object recognition and depth detection to create their effects. Facebook’s camera will be able to recognize specific objects like a coffee cup, and bubble up related effects to users like steam coming off the cup or sharks swimming inside the coffee. Meanwhile, anyone can now use the Frame Studio to upload simple, static overlaid image filters that will appear in Facebook Camera to their friends or a Page’s fans. There’s no need for coding knowledge to use Frame Studio, you just upload an image and your name will appear on the Frame’s preview and News Feed posts to give you credit. Facebook’s Frame Studio lets anyone create an image filter For now Facebook won’t allow any branding or advertising unless pre-approved, though it will eventually monetize the platform, with a spokesperson saying “We are focused on making this product great for people before introducing paid ways for businesses to participate.” Zuckerberg imagines AR experiences breaking down into three major categories: augmenting objects in the physical world with additional information like putting directions atop the street or a restaurant’s reviews on their storefront, layering new virtual objects onto reality like a chess board or working television and enhancing objects that are already there with extra effects, like giving you a glitter beard or adding a castle turret to your apartment building. Zuckerberg sees three areas for AR experiences (from left): Overlaying information, adding virtual objects and enhancing real objects Zuckerberg tells me people underestimate AR as just, “Oh, a lot of people are using these primitive tools because, I don’t know, like this is what kids do now.” But he believes that as the necessary tech finally arrives and developers get creative, we’ll be doing much more than just adding fake mustaches to our faces. Developers could make informational tools like overlaid suggestions from experts on businesses, interactive games and mind-bending art that Zuckerberg says would be impossible to create in the real world. Meanwhile, users will be able to add augmented reality notes to different specific locations, so they could tell friends their favorite dish at a restaurant. Anyone can use the simple Frame Studio to upload static camera effects Developers can user three inputs to trigger their augmented reality effects: Face Tracker (but not identity or facial recognition), Sensor data, such as the gyroscope and location, and Scripting APIs to pull in data from other apps and respond to user inputs in real time. Launch partners and experiences include Manchester United pulling in soccer match data and “GOOAALL!” image overlays with crowd noises, while game developer EA has built a Mass Effect-themed helmet mask that pulls in stats from your progress in the game. Nike will overlay a sweatband on your head and pull in your recent running route as an overlaid map. AR Studio developers can also make effects for Facebook Live, with effects launching today including an overlaid viewer polling This or That feature and comment hashtags that surface a Giphy Live animated GIF the broadcaster can show on-screen. Facebook Live’s new augmented reality effects can be built with the Camera Effects Platform’s AR Studio tool For now, Zuckerberg says that at Facebook, “we definitely see ourselves as more on the software and services side.” Luckily, the next phase of AR on camera phones won’t require special hardware. “We don’t need to build the phones because the phones are already there.” Yet he admits, “In the beginning of any platform, the hardware and software are not separable,” so when AR glasses technology comes of age, Facebook might end up making its own. At that point, Zuckerberg’s grand vision sees augmented reality as an economic equalizer. “The ability to just have glasses or eventually contact lenses where you can overlay whatever information you want . . .[means] we could put a TV on the wall and have it be a $1 app instead of a $500 piece of hardware that a lot of people can’t afford. So if the glasses cost $500 or whatever it is, you’re saving a ton of money compared to all the other hardware that you would have to buy.”  And that’s where augmented reality blends with Zuckerberg’s 6,000-word manifesto on the future of community. One aspect of his letter discussed how automation could force some people out of traditional jobs and into roles more directly serving their community and creating art. AR could make the latter easier and more affordable. “I think more people are going to be doing work and spending more of their time . . . connecting with people and expressing themselves and doing art,” Zuckerberg tells me. “And that I think dovetails very well with an AR world where a lot of what we’re going to be able to do is just about creating ideas and crafting them and sharing them. In AR, paint is free.” The previous computing platforms were entirely digital and accessible to anyone connected to the internet. But the real world is huge — bigger than even Facebook can fill with augmented reality experiences. By opening this developer platform, Facebook doesn’t have to build everything by itself. While Snapchat might have had a headstart in bringing AR to consumers, Facebook has just mapped out how it plans to take augmented reality several steps further.  \n",

            "299 The Mercury Effect\n",
            "In 1999 the eponymous owner of the popular proto-blog Stile Project wrote a post called “The Mercury Effect.” In it Stile described receiving a video from some fans who had, if I remember correctly, tortured a stray cat to death in his honor; they appeared to have been inspired by the other shocking material he’d posted and solicited. Stile briefly discussed the despondency into which this event had plunged him and his failing hopes for the human race. The title referred to the madness visited upon haberdashers by an invisible force, something to which he perhaps sensed a modern analog. He concluded: “Something wonderful is going to happen at midnight.” That night, he turned on his webcam’s live broadcast function, stepped onto a chair, and hung himself. Or appeared to. A few days and a great deal of speculation later, it was revealed that the whole thing was a hoax, something Stile was fond of perpetrating — though this one was especially cruel. All this material has passed from the internet’s memory (even Archive.org’s), but I’ve never been able to forget it. This horrible little episode seems a to me a spiritual precursor to this weekend’s all-too-real socially promoted murder, and the issues that have resurfaced in its wake. But for all the talk about content moderation, machine learning, flag-monitoring algorithms, the problem isn’t the platform, and it isn’t one that can be solved by the platform. That’s because the problem is people. I wrote a while back in Hate that not only is it naive to think the tools we create won’t be used for evil, but it’s irresponsible to pretend so. This is just another example of that. Connect depressed people with a support network here, and you connect white supremacists with gun dealers there. You make a forum for supporting recent immigrants here, and you make one for choosing women to harass there. Let a zoo share a baby giraffe with millions, let someone else stream the murder of a stranger. This is a direct, unavoidable consequence of the tools; they’re not being “abused” or “misappropriated.” Routers and switches don’t care if they relay coding tutorials or child porn, just like a car doesn’t care whether you drive it into a garage or a crowd. By empowering people to broadcast themselves, you empower the meek and the oppressed equally as much as the dangerous and the hateful. What did you expect? Those people are out there in their millions. They want you to experience the extent of their hate just as much as a lonely kid wants to get support from her peers. As with the Morlocks in The Time Machine, every once in a while those of us living in blissful ignorance are reminded of their presence by some horrific act. That sort of thing was always happening, but now you’re aware of it. Thanks, internet. You won’t like the solutions. The first one is: disconnect. Don’t use the tools of the information age to connect with the world at large. I think we can all agree that it’s a little late to try putting that particular genie back in the bottle. Even if millions of people submitted themselves to a modern asceticism and denied themselves access to social media and other communication tools, it accomplishes nothing. If anything, it merely moves the needle of the remaining online population towards the side of extreme sharing. So we can forget about disconnecting. The second one is: submit to extremely invasive content monitoring. Live TV has faced a problem that is at least superficially similar and networks’ solution — delayed live broadcasting and someone with their finger on the “cut to commercial” button — works, after a fashion. But the volume of material put on Facebook, Twitter,  Instagram and so on is such that this approach is quickly rendered absurd. Even hundreds of thousands of moderators assisted by the latest tools struggle to keep up with the fraud, gore, and porn that would otherwise engulf the web. Could machine learning algorithms eventually learn the difference between a sleeping person and a dead one? A scene from an action move and a real murder? There is great promise here but the flip side of that is the idea that everything you create will be analyzed frame by frame, every action categorized and recorded with a granularity that may creep out even the most permissive and laissez-faire of us. And even if the machines had their way with our content, it would still require an army of humans to verify each decision. Platforms have already learned that lesson. The only feasible way to vet content quickly and accurately is through the community, but it is in order that it may be provided to that community that the content must be vetted. It’s a Gordian Knot, and us without a sword. The third “solution” is to admit there isn’t one. Admit the problem as it stands can’t be resolved, that solutions at best merely hide or delay it, that the fundamental nature of the tools and platforms we’ve created enables both miracles and enormities. We can appreciate the former while doing our best to combat the causes of the latter. If people didn’t go around killing each other all the time, we wouldn’t be forced into uncomfortable acknowledgement of the fact that all is not well in the world. Wouldn’t that be nice? So, the elevation of humanity’s ethical acumen. More of a long-term goal, I’d say. The thing is, the kind of philosophically-inclined defeatism I just endorsed isn’t really a crowd pleaser. When you’ve got a billion angry users and a board breathing down your neck, you’ve got to take action — even when there’s no action to take. But in this case can you, or more specifically Mark Zuckerberg, even say “we’re working on it”? We know as well as he does that Facebook can’t prevent this stuff. The risk is baked into the platform. Real-time sharing is fundamental to the company’s vision of the future of communication. It’s too late to go back on that. The best they can hope to do is react faster. Can he lie, or prevaricate, about their hopes to solve this, and get away with it? Because there isn’t really a way forward; in a few weeks or months, when something like this happens again, he’ll be called to account. The reality of the problem’s insolubility will catch up to any promises he makes. So why make them? People aren’t going to leave Facebook because it has no way of censoring the real world. In this case, Zuckerberg’s position is stable enough that he may well tell the (relatively) unvarnished truth, albeit with the frame of reference changed a little. The risk of unwillingly hosting atrocities is inherent to Facebook’s mission (he will say) to connect all the people of the globe. There is no way to prevent it except by infringing on the privileges, perhaps even the rights, of those people — and Facebook will always decline to do that. What’s more, he may add, sunlight is after all the best disinfectant. We have to know of these people, these problems, before we can address them. Shall we remain inside our safe little bubble, hearing only that which pleases us and seeing not that which frightens or confuses us? Shall we be forever free of cognitive dissonance, isolated from disharmony long enough that we forget that we are surrounded with it, a few of us merely lucky enough to have the choice of ignoring it? Well, maybe Zuck won’t say that exactly, but the sentiment, I suspect, may come through. We’re only human, and the internet reflects that. What’s to fix?  \n",

            "Facebook  is facing backlash after a Cleveland man uploaded a video of himself shooting someone to the social network, and followed it with a Live video confessing to the murder. The slaying and its subsequent distribution across Facebook has raised questions about how the company moderates violent content. Justin Osofsky, Facebook’s vice president of global operations, released a statement and timeline of the events and videos surrounding the incident. Osofsky’s statements hand off the responsibility for policing content on Facebook to its users, although he acknowledged the company can do better at moderation. He says artificial intelligence and new policies governing how videos are shared could present solutions to the issue, and that Facebook will try to speed up its current review process. “As a result of this terrible series of events, we are reviewing our reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible. In this case, we did not receive a report about the first video, and we only received a report about the second video — containing the shooting — more than an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted. We received reports about the third video, containing the man’s live confession, only after it had ended,” Osofsky wrote. 11:09AM PDT — First video, of intent to murder, uploaded. Not reported to Facebook.\n",
            "11:11AM PDT — Second video, of shooting, uploaded.\n",
            "11:22AM PDT — Suspect confesses to murder while using Live, is live for 5 minutes.\n",
            "11:27AM PDT — Live ends, and Live video is first reported shortly after.\n",
            "12:59PM PDT — Video of shooting is first reported.\n",
            "1:22PM PDT — Suspect’s account disabled; all videos no longer visible to public. The timeline demonstrates the failures of Facebook’s moderation system, which relies on user reports to flag controversial or violent content. While the Live video of the man’s confession was quickly reported by another user, the video of the killing itself went unreported and therefore remained online for nearly two hours. “Artificial intelligence, for example, plays an important part in this work, helping us prevent the videos from being reshared in their entirety. (People are still able to share portions of the videos in order to condemn them or for public awareness, as many news outlets are doing in reporting the story online and on television),” Osofsky said. Even with advances in artificial intelligence, it’s not clear that Facebook can prevent Live from being used to broadcast violence. The livestreaming service has already been used to share videos of shootings, torture, and sexual assault. And while users are angry at Facebook for allowing the Cleveland killing to be livestreamed, users were also outraged when a “technical glitch” caused the removal of video documenting the police murder of Philando Castile. Osofsky says that the Cleveland videos “goes against our policies and everything we stand for,” but there are times when users will expect Facebook to preserve violent videos because they have political importance. It’s a delicate balance, and one that isn’t likely to be solved by AI alone. “Facebook isn’t going to stop a murder. And I don’t care how good the AI gets, it’s unlikely any time soon to say ‘hey, that video is some person killing another person, don’t stream that.'” Mike Masnick noted on Techdirt. “Yes, senseless murders and violence lead people to go searching for answers, but sometimes there are no answers. And demanding answers from a random tool that was peripherally used connected to the senseless violence doesn’t seem helpful at all.”  \n",

            "Ahead of Facebook’s  annual developers conference, F8, Facebook shared the demographic makeup of this year’s expected attendees exclusively with TechCrunch. Of the people who chose to disclose, 28.7% self-identified as women (a 4.9% increase from last year) and 19.3% self-identified as underrepresented ethnicities in tech (black, Latinx, Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander), representing a 5.6% increase from last year. For the second year in a row, Facebook has also donated $250,000 worth of F8 proceeds to fund a scholarship program for underrepresented people in tech. This year, Facebook has donated some of the proceeds from F8 to Hack Reactor’s Telegraph Track for underrepresented engineers. “The F8 donation will fuel the expansion of Telegraph track as we plan to award full-tuition scholarships to 14 underrepresented engineers looking to join our Telegraph Track community,” Hack Reactor ‎Director of Diversity and Inclusion Albrey Brown told TechCrunch in an email. Last year, Facebook donated the money to Dev Bootcamp to fund scholarships for 20 people of color and/or women to participate in the 19-week program. “F8, in and of itself, is a cross-section not just of Facebook, but of the industry as a whole,” Facebook Diversity Business Partner Kiva Wilson told TechCrunch. Wilson went on to say that the upward trend in diverse representation at F8 is one Facebook works hard for, and “frankly, is exciting and provides a bit more encouragement.” Facebook first started collecting the demographic makeup of its F8 attendees in 2015. That’s because tech conferences, including this publication’s beloved Disrupt, are notoriously dominated by male attendees. Compared to Facebook’s employee demographics, its conference for developers is more racially diverse but not more diverse when it comes to gender. Underrepresented racial minorities make up just 10% of Facebook’s employee base in the U.S., while they make up 19.3% of attendees at F8. Facebook is 33% female, while F8 attendees are just 28.7% female. Regarding speakers at F8, Wilson wouldn’t disclose the demographics or names, but said attendees will be able to notice an improvement this year compared to last year. “I am a full proponent and believer in the concept that you can’t be what you can’t see,” Wilson said.  \n",

In this episode, we discuss how digital design is in a unique position to make an impact on the world, dive into the details of what the evolution of design looked like at Facebook, and learn the importance of three little words: understand, identify, execute.  Facebook has grown immensely throughout the five-and-a-half years Woods has worked there. Throughout our interview, he gives us an inside look at how the design team grew from a few dozen to a few hundred, explaining the trials the team faced as it scaled and the tools they used to overcome their problems. On how to approach designing a new product or feature, Woods says there are three steps: understand, identify, and execute. Take the time to understand what it is you’re trying to accomplish with the product. Use that understanding to identify the biggest problems you need to solve. And execute on the idea by focusing on getting it done and making it real. Jared Erondu and Bobby Ghoshal are the hosts of High Resolution.

            "303 Facebook issues statement after murder suspect shares video of shooting in Cleveland [Updated]\n",
            "Facebook has issued a statement after a video showing a fatal shooting was uploaded onto the social media network by the alleged murderer. Cleveland Police say that Steve Stephens broadcast the killing of an unidentified elderly man on Facebook on Sunday evening and is the target of a manhunt as of this writing. [Update: The victim has been identified as 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. Facebook issued a second statement clarifying that the shooting was uploaded by Stephens after the murder, not broadcast on Facebook Live.] Stephens also posted two more videos in which he claimed to have to committed other murders and said he was going to “kill as many people as I can,” before his account was shut down by Facebook . In a statement to journalists, a company spokesperson said “This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook. We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.” Though Facebook’s policy prohibits content that glorifies or incites violence, that rule is inherently difficult to enforce on a social media platform that encourages its users to post photos and videos in real time or soon after they are taken. Facebook Live launched to all users almost exactly one year ago and while the majority of videos are innocuous, the feature has broadcast, both accidentally and on purpose, heinous acts of violence. These include the shooting of a toddler, the torture of a teenager with special needs and sexual assaults in Chicago and Sweden. The Chicago case prompted questions about whether people who watch crimes live but don’t report them can be legally charged and what jurisdictions are responsible. Furthermore, once media has been put on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, it’s easy for other users to save and re-share. This means victims and families are forced to re-experience the trauma and is an especially insidious problem in cases where live streaming was arguably used by perpetrators as a psychological weapon.  \n",

            "Facebook  proudly announced today that it has — it thinks — put an end to the nefarious doings of a “sophisticated,” “coordinated operation” that has been spamming the site for the last six months. In a blog post, Facebook’s security team suggested the “inauthentic likes” came from accounts in “Bangladesh, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and a number of other countries.” That narrows it down! Actually, it sounds pretty smart: The accounts would appear, like a few pages, spam them, then fall silent. Proxies and other means were taken to make it seem that these fake accounts weren’t centrally administrated — which, of course, they were. As far as volume, the post scrupulously avoids real numbers: As we remove the rest of the inauthentic likes, we expect that 99% of impacted Pages with more than 10,000 likes will see a drop of less than 3%. If you can figure out what that means, feel free to comment below. What about the fake likes and accounts removed before now? How many pages were affected? Are pages with fewer likes affected less, or more? Are there other networks currently being fought in similar ways, and, if so, what kind of drops should we expect when those get rolled up? No doubt this is good news for everyone, but I can’t help but get the same feeling from Facebook here that I get from Twitter when it dances around the numbers of bots and spammers on its network. The numbers will be high, of course, but even if they’re within reasonable limits, no user or investor likes to hear that there are 10, 20 or 100 million fake accounts or likes. The dismantlement of this particular network comes hot on the heels of an announcement by the company earlier this week that it was stepping up its efforts against spam and fake news.  \n",

            "305 Female Marines group appeals to Sheryl Sandberg to fix Facebook’s revenge porn problem\n",
            "With a letter straight to the top, a group of Marines is demanding that Facebook get a grip on the systemic harassment that plagues its female servicemembers. In March, Facebook became the epicenter of the Marines United scandal, which exposed a massive online community where users shared often intimate photos of servicewomen without their consent. While such content isn’t limited to Facebook, it has thrived there and continues to do so in the aftermath of the scandal, which the USMC is still struggling to contain. In a thorough, thoughtfully articulated letter, veteran and Not in My Marine Corps co-founder Erin Kirk-Cuomo calls for Sheryl Sandberg to take a personal interest in fighting the spread of nonconsensual photo sharing and gendered harassment on Facebook: “We applaud the updates in facial recognition software in an effort to end the sharing of revenge pornography announced by Facebook last week. However, Facebook has been negligent in removing pages, groups, and users, that actively promote nonconsensual intimate photo sharing and incite sexual violence and harassment. For Facebook leadership to publicize their value to the military family, then ignore its complicity in the misconduct perpetrated by its users is, at best, naive. At its worst, this failure directly contributes to the inescapable sexism that is part of the military culture.”  Sandberg’s interest in gender equality is well established, if at times superficial. As Facebook’s COO, she’s perfectly positioned to put her money where her mouth is — like when she announced the company’s enhanced family leave benefits — but Sandberg rarely wades into Facebook’s messy platform policies around issues like harassment, an area where she could effect real change. In her letter, Kirk-Cuomo argues that Facebook’s failure to act decisively against harassment against its service members is both hypocrisy and implicit approval of the kind of toxic behavior that’s been allowed to run rampant on its platform: “In the wake of the Marines United unmasking, dozens of similar and copycat groups have been created. The current screening and reporting process remains largely ineffective. I have heard from concerned users that they have been forced to report these pages multiple times a day for weeks in order for Facebook to review the validity of the claims all while hiding behind automated and couched responses. This slow removal process allows this cancer to metastasize.” Far from just complaining, Kirk-Cuomo offers specific solutions for containing and eradicating the objectionable content, suggesting that Facebook work more closely with military representatives to “quickly eliminate groups, pages, and users” who share and spread content that violates its terms of service. Facebook has an unfortunate tendency to over-rely on its own vulnerable communities to self-police, yet tends to drag its feet when community members report harassment. Considering the scope of its resources, and how indispensable Facebook can be for military families, it’s unfortunate that female Marines now have to shoulder that burden. “You said in your book Lean In, ‘We cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change,'” Kirk-Cuomo writes. “I am making you aware, Ms. Sandberg.”  \n",

            "306 Facebook again under fire for spreading illegal content\n",
            "An investigation by a British newspaper into child sexual abuse content and terrorist propaganda being shared on Facebook  has once again drawn critical attention to how the company handles complaints about offensive and extremist content being shared on its platform. And, indeed, how Facebook’s algorithmically driven user generated content sharing platform apparently encourages the spread of what can also be illegal material. In a report published today, The Times newspaper accuses Facebook of publishing child pornography after one of its reporters created a fake profile and was quickly able to find offensive and potentially illegal content on the site — including pedophilic cartoons; a video that apparently shows a child being violently abused; and various types of terrorist propaganda including a beheading video made by an ISIS supporter, and comments celebrating a recent attack against Christians in Egypt. The Times says it reported the content to Facebook but in most instances was apparently told the imagery and videos did not violate the site’s community standards. (Although, when it subsequently contacted the platform identifying itself as The Times newspaper it says some of pedophilic cartoons that had been kept up by moderators were subsequently removed.) Facebook says it has since removed all the content reported by the newspaper. A draft law in Germany is proposing to tackle exactly this issue — using the threat of large fines for social media platforms that fail to quickly take down illegal content after a complaint. Ministers in the German cabinet backed the proposed law earlier this month, which could be adopted in the current legislative period. And where one European government is heading, others in the region might well be moved to follow. The UK government, for example, has once again been talking tougher on social platforms and terrorism, following a terror attack in London last month — with the Home Secretary putting pressure on companies including Facebook to build tools to automate the flagging up and taking down of terrorist propaganda. The Times says its reporter created a Facebook profile posing as an IT professional in his thirties and befriending more than 100 supporters of ISIS while also joining groups promoting “lewd or pornographic” images of children. “It did not take long to come across dozens of objectionable images posted by a mix of jihadists and those with a sexual interest in children,” it writes. The Times showed the material it found to a UK QC, Julian Knowles, who told it that in his view many of the images and videos are likely to be illegal — potentially breaching UK indecency laws, and the Terrorism Act 2006 which outlaws speech and publications that directly or indirectly encourage terrorism. “If someone reports an illegal image to Facebook and a senior moderator signs off on keeping it up, Facebook is at risk of committing a criminal offense because the company might be regarded as assisting or encouraging its publication and distribution,” Knowles told the newspaper. Last month Facebook faced similar accusations over its content moderation system, after a BBC investigation looked at how the site responded to reports of child exploitation imagery, and also found the site failed to remove the vast majority of reported imagery. Last year the news organization also found that closed Facebook groups were being used by pedophiles to share images of child exploitation. Facebook declined to provide a spokesperson to be interviewed about The Times report, but in an emailed statement Justin Osofsky, VP global operations, told us: “We are grateful to The Times for bringing this content to our attention. We have removed all of these images, which violate our policies and have no place on Facebook. We are sorry that this occurred. It is clear that we can do better, and we’ll continue to work hard to live up to the high standards people rightly expect of Facebook.” Facebook says it employs “thousands” of human moderators, distributed in offices around the world (such as Dublin for European content) to ensure 24/7 availability. However given the platform has close to 2 billion monthly active users (1.86BN MAUs at the end of 2016, to be exact) this is very obviously just the tiniest drop in the ocean of content being uploaded to the site every second of every day. Human moderation clearly cannot scale to review so much content without there being far more human moderators employed by Facebook — a move it clearly wants to resist, given the costs involved (Facebook’s entire company headcount only totals just over 17,000 staff). Facebook has implemented Microsoft’s Photo DNA technology, which scans all uploads for known images of child abuse. However tackling all types of potentially problematic content is a very hard problem to try to fix with engineering; one that is not easily automated, given it requires individual judgement calls based on context as well as the specific content, while also potentially factoring in differences in legal regimes in different regions, and differing cultural attitudes. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently publicly discussed the issue — writing that “one of our greatest opportunities to keep people safe” is “building artificial intelligence to understand more quickly and accurately what is happening across our community”. But he also conceded that Facebook needs to “do more”, and cautioned that an AI fix for content moderation is “years” out. “Right now, we’re starting to explore ways to use AI to tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and actual terrorist propaganda so we can quickly remove anyone trying to use our services to recruit for a terrorist organization. This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide,” he wrote in February, before going on to emphasize that “protecting individual security and liberty” is also a core plank of Facebook’s community philosophy — which underscores the tricky ‘free speech vs offensive speech’ balancing act the social media giant continues to try to pull off. In the end, illegal speech may be the driving force that catalyzes a substantial change to Facebook’s moderating processes — by providing harder red lines where it feels forced to act (even if defining what constitutes illegal speech in a particular region vs what is merely abusive and/or offensive entails another judgement challenge). One factor is inescapable: Facebook has ultimately agreed that all of the problem content identified via various different high profile media investigations does indeed violate its community standards, and does not belong on its platform. Which rather begs the question why was it not taken down when it was first reported? Either that’s systemic failure of its moderating system — or rank hypocrisy at the corporate level. The Times says it has reported its findings to the UK’s Metropolitan Police and the National Crime Agency. It’s unclear whether Facebook will face criminal prosecution in the UK for refusing to remove potentially illegal terrorist and child exploitation content. The newspaper also calls out Facebook for algorithmically promoting some of the offensive material — by suggesting that users join particular groups or befriend profiles that had published it. On that front features on Facebook such as ‘Pages You Might Known’ automatically suggest additional content a user might be interested on, based on factors such as mutual friends, work and education information, networks you’re part of and contacts that have been imported — but also many other undisclosed factors and signals. And just as Facebook’s New Feed machine learning algorithms have been accused of favoring and promoting fake news clickbait, the underlying workings of its algorithmic processes for linking people and interests look to be being increasingly pulled into the firing line over how they might be accidentally aiding and abetting criminal acts.  \n",

            "307 Facebook Moments’s standalone website doesn’t do much\n",
            "Late last year, Facebook brought its mobile photo-sharing application Moments to the web in a limited capacity by adding a link to the service in the desktop version of Facebook. We’ve spotted that Facebook also has a standalone web version for the service that offers access to the online albums you’ve previously shared with friends. However, like the stripped-down version of Moments within Facebook, Moments’ web version is similarly non-functional. While the site displays the full list of albums you’ve created as well as who they’ve been shared with, the common features you’d expect a web version of a photo-sharing app to have simply don’t work. For example, the buttons for favoriting or commenting on photos don’t work – instead they prompt a pop-up box to appear which directs you to download the Moments mobile application. You can choose to enter in your phone number in this box in order to have the app download link texted to your phone.  It’s like a marketing site for the mobile app, almost. Also unavailable on the web version is the ability to work with your photos or albums in any other way – you can create new albums, edit existing albums, or share albums with friends. That begs the question, of course – why bother have a web version of Moments at all? The answer is fairly simple, as it turns out. It gives a way for people who don’t have the Moments app installed the ability to view the photos you’re sharing with them. Facebook confirmed the website launched “pretty recently,”* but didn’t offer to share its longer-term plans for Moments on the web going forward. However, not having a fully functioning website may be a misstep for Moments, as it could serve as a means of getting new users interested in the service before committing to yet another mobile app install, and it could increase the engagement from those who are already regular users of the service. After all, expanding to the web is something that’s served other, mobile-first apps well, like Facebook-owned Instagram, for example, and Facebook Messenger. Even Tinder recently debuted a web counterpart. The existence of Moments, and Facebook’s continued investment in the app, is also more confusing these days, given that the new Stories feature built in to Facebook includes a direct sharing option. That means you can bypass the Moments app entirely in order to privately send photos with a select friend or friends. The differentiating factor here is that Facebook Stories’ Direct option is meant to be more of a one-off sharing feature, where Moments is about creating albums that can stick around for a longer period of time. Facebook Moments’ website is here. *Update: The web experience launched “pretty recently” Facebook had said, but later corrected this to mean months ago. Whoops! The rollout of the functionality that pre-fills the web experience with users’ Moments content was staged, so some may have had earlier than others.   \n",

            "308 Facebook Messenger now supports group payments\n",
            "Facebook  introduced person-to-person payments within Messenger in early 2015, but today the company announced the feature is expanding to support groups, as well. The payments feature essentially works the same in group chats as in private ones, but now allows users to pay either everyone in the group or individual members through a click of the payments icon (the dollar sign). The payments icon can be selected after first clicking on the plus sign in the bottom-left side of the group conversation. This is where the other, lesser-used features like games, location sharing, ride requests and more are tucked away in a new, scrollable user interface that arrived alongside Facebook’s debut of its Messenger assistant, M, earlier this month.   Facebook suggests the new feature would be useful for groups where everyone is chipping in on a purchase — like a group gift — or are splitting a restaurant bill. These are areas where people today still tend to turn to standalone payment services, like PayPal, Venmo or Square Cash. In addition to sending payments to other group members, you can request payments from the group right within your chat. To do so, enter the amount you want to request per person or the total sum to be divided evenly through the group, either including yourself in that calculation or not, Facebook says. You can also add a note about what the money is for (e.g. “pizza party”) then hit “Request” to send it out to the group conversation. A message will appear in the group chat to show who has paid. Those details are available by viewing the Request Details in full-screen, too.  The service is free to use and does not require a password, Facebook notes. Payments is an area of Facebook’s business that hasn’t received as much focus over the years, despite the social network’s potential to collect and store payment data for its sizable user base — information that could then be used in other areas across Facebook — like gaming or e-commerce, for example. But Facebook has been hesitant to fully acknowledge its ambitions with payments, having said in the past with the launch of Messenger payments that it was “not building a payments business.” Instead, the goal was to simply make Messenger  itself more useful, and therefore, more competitive with rivals, it had indicated. That continues today with group payments — Facebook is not taking a cut. However, payments is a critical feature for today’s messaging apps. Facebook Messenger competitors — like Snapchat and China’s WeChat — already support in-app payments, and Kik this month detailed its intentions to add payments to its own app, too. The move to add group payments to Messenger also comes at a time when Facebook has been rumored to be preparing the launch of a digital payments business in India within its other messaging app, WhatsApp. Group payments is live starting today in the U.S. The feature is available on Android and desktop, initially.

            "309 Facebook’s Communities Summit will gather Group admins Zuck wants to empower\n",
            "Mark Zuckerberg’s humanitarian manifesto from February outlined his desire to “build more tools to empower community leaders . . . to run and grow their groups the way they’d like.” On June 22nd and 23rd in Chicago, Facebook will hold its first free Facebook Communities Summit to celebrate group admins and better equip them to lead their flocks. Only Facebook Group admins are permitted to apply here, and several hundred will be chosen to attend. Facebook explains that: “You’ll hear from Facebook executives about new products we’re building  to help admins grow and manage their groups.  You’ll have an opportunity to participate in workshops  and give the Facebook team real-time feedback on what will make groups better for you.  And you’ll get to meet other admins from across the country who are building remarkable communities through groups.” Applications will be open for a limited time to Group admins from the US, though their communities can be international. Up to three admins can apply together, though only one application per Group is allowed. Some Groups will be explicitly invited to send admins with a nomination process they’ll receive information about. Applicants should hear back in May. The Summit itself is free, and Facebook will cover the cost of hotel accommodations and food so as long as the admins can get to Chicago, it will be affordable for anyone to participate. That’s critical to ensuring a diverse set of attendees that can disseminate the strategies learned at the Summit to every community.   \n",

            "Write “You owe me $20” and Messenger  will suggest you use its payments feature. If someone says “goodbye,” Messenger will recommend a “bye-bye” GIF. That’s how Facebook’s  new M Suggestions work. Facebook’s artificial intelligence assistant will privately interject these recommendations above the redesigned one-line message composer in your Messenger conversations, and your friends won’t see the results unless you approve. M Suggestions roll out to all iOS and Android users in the U.S. today, with more countries coming. They’re designed to surface all the features buried inside Messenger as it strives to become more than just an SMS replacement. Beyond stickers and payments, M Suggestions also can recommend location sharing, timed reminders, group chat polls and ridesharing options from Lyft and Uber. You might remember M from when it began testing in 2015. Since then, a small number of users have been allowed to message M any request, which it tries to fulfill, first relying on AI to parse the question and retrieve answers it’s already learned. If it’s stumped, it falls back to a team of human staffers who try to help, and then teach M to do the job by itself next time. The problem is “it cannot scale to millions of people” says Facebook M product manager Laurent Landowski, who co-founded the natural language processing startup Wit.AI that Facebook acquired. So now, “The original version of M will continue to help us understand and learn more about . . . what we need to build and what people want.” Essentially, the open-ended M will continue to process requests for a closed set of beta testers so Facebook can determine what tasks its AI can reliably fulfill, and what text indicates what intent. Then it will slowly bring those capabilities over to M Suggestions. Facebook began testing M Suggestions in December, as noted by BuzzFeed, and The Information reported that the full-fledged M personal assistant would be switching gears to become more of a training ground for Facebook’s AI. M Suggestions will open Facebook’s AI to a much wider audience. With the new Messenger composer redesign, many of the buttons for its different features have been collapsed inside an expandable menu, but M Suggestions will help you fish them out.  And rather than apply the same experience to everyone, M will learn individual users’ habits and personalize itself for them. If you always ignore the M Suggestions, you’ll see less of them. Or if you never use its payments feature but constantly send stickers, it’ll just suggest you use the latter. And if you really hate M, you can use the Messenger settings to mute it entirely or turn off certain kinds of recommendations. Even though it’s only an AI, not a human, some people might be a bit freaked out by Facebook scanning the content of their messages to provide these suggestions. For now, M Suggestions are focused on Messenger’s internal features. But the inclusion of the Lyft and Uber ride-hailing option signal it could have bigger ambitions for recommending outside developer services. Facebook currently has a big issue with bot discovery, having launched the automated messaging agents last year without an easy way to find ones to use. M Suggestions could potentially evolve to recommend bots for you to pull into your conversations. While there are plenty of problems M could one day help you solve, for now it’s dealing with one of Facebook’s longest-running issues: There are more features than you know what to do with.  \n",

            "311 Facebook puts link to 10 tips for spotting ‘false news’ atop feed\n",
            "Today Facebook  begins fighting misinformation with news literacy education, in addition to product features. This week, users in 14 countries, including the U.S., will see an alert above the News Feed several times over the next few days that links them to Facebook’s Help Center where they can read “Tips to Spot False News.” Written while working with news standards nonprofit First Draft, these tips include being skeptical of sensational headlines and checking for phony URLs. Notably, Facebook is labeling the scourge “false news” instead of the more popular term “fake news.” The company tells me this is because “fake news” has taken on a life of its own, and “false news” more accurately communicates that it’s talking about intentionally false content that tries to be confused with legitimate news. After all, Donald Trump has begun labeling as “fake news” any opinions or facts with which he disagrees. Facebook VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri writes “It’s not a new phenomenon, and all of us — tech companies, media companies, newsrooms, teachers — have a responsibility to do our part in addressing it.” Unfortunately, Facebook could have made these tips much easier to consume and more likely to be read if it had just hosted them inside the News Feed alert itself. By instead linking out to the Help Center, the alert is likely to be repeatedly ignored by some, while others decline to wait for an outside site to load. The alert at the top of the News Feed links out to the Facebook Help Center where users can read 10 tips for spotting false news Here’s the list of tips users will find if they click through the link: The tips are helpful and sensible, but the unfortunate fact is that they put a ton of faith in Facebook’s 1.8 billion users to exert lots of cognitive effort to detect false news. Facebook came into this problem because of the poor news literacy, skepticism and proactive research behavior patterns of the modern news reader. According to studies, more than half of U.S. adults get their news from social media rather than directly from trusted sources, the majority of students can’t reliably distinguish fake news from real news and 20 percent of users on social media say that they’ve changed a social or political stance because of social media.  That’s why it’s also tried to take matters into its own hands with product changes and other projects, like working with outside fact checkers to label disputed news stories with warnings in the News Feed. It’s also provided a special option for flagging false news stories, down-ranked suspicious stories, began detecting and blocking false news spammers, denied false news publishers the ability to buy Facebook ads and funded the $14 million News Integrity Initiative. But in the end it will fall to users to make up their own minds about what’s real and fake. And it’s tough to trust that any list of tips will suddenly make them strong fact checkers.  \n",

            "312 Facebook addresses revenge porn with tech to prevent people from re-sharing intimate images\n",
            "Facebook  has implemented a new photo-matching technology to ensure people can’t re-share images previously reported and tagged as revenge porn — intimate photos of people shared without their consent. That means if someone tries to share a photo that Facebook has previously taken down, that person will see a pop-up saying the photo violates Facebook’s policies and that Facebook will not allow the person to share that particular photo on Facebook, Messenger or Instagram. “We’ve focused in on this because of the unique harm that this kind of sharing has on its victims,” Facebook Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis told me. “In the newsroom post we refer to a specific piece of research around the unique harm this has for victims. I think that’s where the focus was for this moving forward.” The figure Davis is referring to is that 93 percent of people affected by the sharing of non-consensual intimate images report “significant emotional distress” and 82 percent report significant difficulties in other aspects of their lives, according to the US Victims of Non-Consensual Intimate Images. Although Facebook has enabled people to report images for a while now, the language around revenge porn is now more clear and “very specific to these types of intimate images,” Davis said. In “many” cases, Facebook will also deactivate the account of the person who posted the revenge porn. Facebook has also partnered with a handful of organizations, like the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative and the Revenge Porn Helpline, to offer support to people who are victims of revenge porn. Revenge porn is a widespread issue on the internet, with one in 25 people in the U.S. being victims of non-consensual image sharing, according to a 2016 report from the Data & Society Research Institute and the Center for Innovative Public Health Research. Facebook’s new tools around tackling revenge porn come shortly after a scandal involving people on both Facebook and Instagram targeting female Marines in private groups. Last year, Facebook Director of Engineering for Applied Machine Learning Joaquin Candela told TechCrunch that the platform was using AI to detect and report offensive photos, but it seems that in instances of revenge porn, humans are still needed. “At this moment, we’re not using AI to go through this particular content,” Davis said. “There is significant context that’s required for reviewing non-consensual sharing.”  \n",

            "313 Embattled Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey leaves Facebook\n",
            "Palmer Luckey  is out at Facebook. The Oculus co-founder, who helped kickstart the recent VR craze with a prototype headset built out of his parents’ garage, has left the company after a year that heralded the launch of the consumer Oculus  Rift but also a number of lawsuits and a pro-Trump meme scandal. Oculus has confirmed the report of Luckey’s departure, first spotted by UploadVR, in a statement to TechCrunch that reads about as much as a eulogy as it does a farewell. “Palmer will be dearly missed,” the statement reads. “Palmer’s legacy extends far beyond Oculus. His inventive spirit helped kickstart the modern VR revolution and build an industry. We’re thankful for everything he did for Oculus and VR, and we wish him all the best.” In an era filled with seemingly countless examples of “bro” founders emerging from top universities and starting companies with their frat brothers, Luckey appeared to be a breath of fresh air. The home-schooled college dropout was a tinkerer who frequented message boards asking for help taking apart and rebuilding game consoles in his parents’ garage before expanding to a deep interest in 3D screens and head-mounted displays. This fascination eventually brought him to encounter legendary game developer John Carmack, who helped the young Luckey gain the attention of the gaming community after showcasing one of his VR headset prototypes at a major gaming conference. The excitement led to a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign that later brought the interest of some major investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund and Formation 8. Facebook acquired Oculus in March of 2014 for $2 billion. Luckey has not commented on what exactly he earned from the deal, but Forbes pins his net worth at $730 million. Luckey’s departure follows a lengthy period of absence from public view brought about by a Daily Beast piece revealing his involvement and funding of a pro-Trump troll group called Nimble America. News of his support came during a time when very few figures in Silicon Valley were publicly showing support for candidate Trump, the most notable being Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook who started the VC firm Founders Fund, which backed Oculus, as well. Though Luckey initially denied funding the group, he ultimately took to social media to apologize in the midst of an upheaval that had many developers threatening to leave the platform. His last public statement (on Facebook, of course) was a mixture of regret and defense, reading, in part, “I am deeply sorry that my actions are negatively impacting the perception of Oculus and its partners. The recent news stories about me do not accurately represent my views… my actions were my own and do not represent Oculus. I’m sorry for the impact my actions are having on the community.” Facebook is generally a well-oiled machine when it comes to public relations — CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a large personal team devoted simply to ensuring he maintains a positive public image — so it really wasn’t all that surprising that the company sought to minimize Luckey’s public exposure. Nevertheless, many were surprised when Luckey did not appear at the Oculus Developer Conference this past fall. In January, Luckey appeared in public to testify as part of an IP lawsuit being brought against him and other co-founders at Oculus VR by ZeniMax Media. Facebook was ordered to pay $500 million in damages to the company, with $50 million being paid by Luckey himself, who was found to have violated his NDA with ZeniMax Media. Following a major executive shakeup at the company that left the entire company more closely nestled beneath Facebook through the appointment of ex-Xiaomi executive Hugo Barra as Facebook VP of VR, many were left wondering where this all would leave the 24-year-old Luckey. UploadVR reported in December that an Oculus spokesperson had told the company that Luckey was still with Facebook and that the company would have “more to share on his new role soon.” Well.  \n",

            "314 Facebook introduces personal fundraising tools, donate buttons in Facebook Live for Pages\n",
            "Facebook today announced it’s expanding its set of online fundraising tools to include its own GoFundMe competitor, with the added support for personal online fundraisers, starting first in the U.S. The new tool will allow Facebook users to raise money for personal crises and other campaigns — like school or medical expenses, emergency situations, funerals and more. In addition, the company is adding the ability for Facebook Pages to add a “donate” button to their live broadcasts on the network. This is not the first time Facebook has stepped into the fundraising space. In 2015, it debuted a Kickstarter-like feature aimed at nonprofits that allowed them to set up a campaign page, explain their goals and collect cash. Last year, the company expanded its fundraising tools to allow individuals to collect funds on behalf of nonprofit organizations, as well.  It was only a matter of time before Facebook introduced similar tools to its wider user base, especially given the continued popularity of these sort of online campaigns and the social activity that surrounds them. However, the personal fundraisers are limited at launch to six key categories: education (tuition, books or classroom supplies); medical (procedures, treatments, injuries); pet medical; crisis relief (public crises or natural disasters); personal emergencies (house fires, theft, car accidents); and funeral and loss (burial expenses, living costs). Facebook says it hopes to expand the category list over time as it automates more of the review process. Facebook says it currently has a 24-hour proactive review process to ensure fundraisers meet category and community policies. The personal fundraisers are also only open to those in the U.S. who are aged 18 or older, and it will first be available in beta. They will also have will have a 6.9% + $.30 fee that will go to “payment processing fees, fundraiser vetting, security and fraud protection,” says Facebook. (Non-profits pay a different fee structure on Facebook, however). GoFundMe, by comparison, takes 7.9% + $.30 for personal or charity campaigns. Similar to its other fundraising products, users visiting the personal campaigns can click buttons to invite friends, share the campaign or click the big, blue button to donate money while remaining on the site. This also encourages more payment transactions across Facebook — an area of its business that is still today under-developed, despite the addition of peer-to-peer payments within Messenger.  Personal Fundraisers Posted by Facebook on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 In addition to personal fundraisers, Facebook Pages will now be able to include “Donate” buttons on their live video broadcasts. This will allow public figures, brands, businesses and other organizations beyond nonprofits to fundraise, too. People watching the live video can choose to either donate as they watch, or after the video ends and is posted on the Page, says Facebook. Updated, 12 PM ET to include additional information about the review process; 3 PM ET with fee structures for personal and non-profits.   \n",

            "315 Facebook will launch group chatbots at F8\n",
            "Facebook  will reveal at its F8 conference a new class of group bots that work inside Messenger group chats. These group bots can keep users informed about real-time news such as a sports game’s progress, e-commerce deliveries and more, according to three sources familiar with the development of the feature. Facebook is already working with top chatbot makers to prepare for the launch. Facebook will open up APIs to allow more developers to start building group bots, too. When asked for comment, a Facebook spokesperson said “we don’t comment on rumors or speculation,” but my sources confirm this is coming. For example, a Messenger group of football fans could add a sports bot to their thread, where it could report score changes, big plays and other news from the game. An e-commerce group bot could keep a group of coworkers informed about the status of their lunch delivery, letting them know that the order is being prepared and when it arrives. Facebook Messenger already features sports news bots from media property theScore and the NBA’s Sacramento Kings, plus food-delivery bots like those from Domino’s. Soon they could be equipped to keep a whole group for friends in the know.  The group bots launch could address two big problems with the Messenger bot platform Facebook launched last year at F8 that TechCrunch previously reported was coming. First, the group bots will act more like news tickers instead of trying to pretend to be a human discussion partner. They’re not really “chatbots” as much as they are “information bots” as people won’t be having the same back-and-forth conversations as they do with one-on-one chatbots. Unripened AI technology and poor understanding of questions led many users to be disappointed with Facebook’s chatbots. Facebook’s head of Messenger David Marcus admitted at TechCrunch Disrupt that “The problem was it got really overhyped, very, very quickly. The basic capabilities we provided at the time weren’t good enough to basically replace traditional app interfaces and experiences.” Since these group bots won’t be the sole conversation partner, there will be less pressure on them to act human, and more opportunity for them to service a specific utility.  Second, their existence in group chats will provide a viral growth mechanism for bots, which don’t have easy discovery channels already. Currently, users have to type a bot’s name into Messenger’s search box to start a conversation with one. There’s no native way to browse for bots, so businesses have to either get the bot’s exact name drilled into people’s heads through marketing or get them to initiate a conversation with a bot through a Facebook News Feed ad. That’s led to the emergence of little-known third-party browsing options like Botlist. With group bots, one user could add a bot to a thread, thereby exposing its existence to other friends in the group. Both particular bots and the whole bots platform could see a rise in recognition and audience, which might attract higher-profile developers and brands to build them. It’s still unclear how exactly users will find and add bots to threads. Facebook doesn’t have a bot store or suggester, but perhaps more bot discovery options will be part of the slew of announcements slated for Facebook’s big yearly F8 development conference on April 18th and 19th in San Jose. We’ll be there to confirm today’s scoop and provide analysis of the rest of the news Facebook reveals. While truly conversational AI will eventually rise to proficiency, Facebook is smart to refocus on group bot technology that can reliably solve real needs today.   \n",

            "316 Facebook opens up 360-degree live streaming to all\n",
            "Facebook just made live streaming 360-degree video relatively easy, provided you have the equipment to capture the content. Users of devices like the new 2017 model Gear 360 just announced at the S8 smartphone launch, or the Insta360 Nano (for iPhone) and Air (for Android), or a host of higher-end models designed for pros, you can go live and broadcast an immersive feed for your audience. The feature works using Facebook’s livestreaming video tech, providing 1080p, 30fps playback and a maximum streaming time of four hours, which should be plenty for whatever you’re planing to immersively immerse your immersion hungry audience within. You’ll need a decent connection to make for a smooth broadcast, as Facebook recommends 4 Mbps down to ensure quality, and you can use either a camera’s dedicated app to go live, or navigate to facebook.com/live/create to use with cameras not already set up specifically to stream using Facebook’s new tool. If you have the Insta360 Air or Nano, both of which I’ve used before, the process is pretty simple. An update available today for the companion apps for both cameras will allow you to select Facebook Live as a broadcast destination when you select the live feature within the app’s options. These provide real-time views of what your audience is seeing on your smartphone’s display as you’re broadcasting, too, which is not something available via some other pro-level options. The app’s interface will also show you how many viewers you currently have, watch the tally of Likes and other reactions, and check out comments as they roll in. Insta360’s cameras already support live broadcasts to Periscope and to YouTube, but Facebook’s in-app integration is a useful way to reach more people with minimal effort and promotion. Live 360 broadcasts aren’t yet embeddable on other sites, however, and they can’t be viewed via Apple TV or Chromecast for big-screen playback just yet. Still, it’s a strong start and a cool content delivery alternative for reporting from the field. The next best thing to being there might just be virtually being there, and this new offering from Facebook might be one of the easiest ways to do that, with a built-in large audience.  \n",

            "Facebook’s  launch of Stories may be the social network’s big news of the week, but some Facebook users have spotted another addition, and are thoroughly confused. A “rocket ship” icon has popped up in the app of select users worldwide, adjacent to the News Feed button. Its appearance is prompting a lot of users to wonder, “what on earth is this thing?” The button may be either at the top of the screen or the bottom, depending on whether the user is on iOS or Android. What has Facebook done now? 😤 I already really dislike that marketplace crap. Now what's this rocket icon thing??? pic.twitter.com/l0obKojCJH — Amanda (@Amanda_Clinton) March 4, 2017  As it turns out, the rocket ship icon is just the latest in Facebook’s ongoing experiments in presenting an alternate News Feed to users – one that consists of posts, articles, photos and videos from sources you haven’t followed, like Facebook Pages or posts news media organizations, for example. While you might not be actively tracking these sources, Facebook believes it’s content that you’ll like. The items displayed in the “rocket ship” feed come from Pages that are similar to those you’ve already liked, as well as those that are popular with your friends – like a video that many people in your network are watching, for instance. This is not a new experiment – Facebook was recently spotted testing an alternative News Feed, but was using a different icon (a small square) at the time. That test was also limited to Android beta users, according to reports. A similar earlier test on iOS actually labeled the second feed with the word “Explore.” The new experiment with the rocket ship, however, is appearing in the mobile version of Facebook across both iOS and Android platforms, including those who have not opted into a beta. Despite Facebook’s advanced algorithms designed to keep users engaged and endlessly scrolling – and its understanding of what a user has liked, watched, and clicked – the company has not heavily focused its efforts on helping users connect more broadly with interests through recommended content. Instead, today’s News Feed is filled with content a user has explicitly liked, whether that’s friends’ posts or updates from Pages users are following. But Facebook has always wanted to have a better angle into people’s interests – especially as other networks (like Twitter) have made it easier to follow news and topics, and not just people, brands, and businesses.

In 2014, the social network experimented again with interests, via its mobile app Rooms, which offered users a means of discussing various topics. But that app eventually failed.  An alternative News Feed-like stream of information could be another way of tackling interests, but popping it into the app without an explanation is clearly confusing to those who have new feature. The expanded test is underway now in markets worldwide, we understand. The rocket ship icon itself is fairly new, based on a number of tweets most of which were either posted this month or the last. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the global test in a statement, saying “We are testing a complementary feed of popular articles, videos, and photos, customized for each person based on content that might be interesting to them. We’ve heard from people that they want an easy way to explore new content they haven’t connected with yet.”  \n",

We’ll be discussing Facebook’s diversity playbook and its strategy to foster inclusion in the workplace. As head of diversity at Facebook, Williams is tasked with trying to make Facebook as diverse as the people who use its platform. Facebook’s user base is 52 percent white in the U.S., compared to 55 percent white in 2015, according to Facebook’s 2016 diversity report. In that report, Facebook disclosed data around sexual orientation and gender identity for the first time. Of the 61 percent of employees who responded, 7 percent identified as LGBTQA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or asexual). “The more different people we have who are focused on solving the problems we have in this world, the better results we will get,” Williams told me at the time. “Sexual orientation and gender identity were two things we know have been categories that have put people in traditionally marginalized positions.” Other confirmed speakers include Salesforce Chief Equality Officer Tony Prophet, 500 Startups Venture Partner Monique Woodard and We the Protestors co-founder DeRay McKesson.

            "320 Facebook Stories looks like an ill-fitting mask\n",
            "Facebook has finally capped off its strategy of cloning Snapchat’s USP by slotting a camera-first, ephemeral multimedia sharing feature into its entire social sharing estate. Today it’s flicked the official switch on a global rollout of the feature in the main Facebook app, where these disappearing Stories are pinned to contacts above the News Feed — thereby making them almost impossible to ignore, especially given their fleeting lifespan. Earlier this month the social sharing giant added a similar visual sharing feature to its Messenger app — triggering complaints that it was messing with the user experience. It did the same, in February, with its messaging platform, WhatsApp, and also annoyed users by trying to replace a text status feature (which it’s since restored). The Facebook Snapchat cloning strategy kicked off in August 2016 when the company debuted the disappearing Stories format on its photo and video sharing platform Instagram, clearly the most natural home for the clone. And Instagram Stories has since apparently managed to dent Snapchat’s growth, which was clearly a core strategic aim for Facebook. That and creating vastly more video inventory across Facebook’s portfolio of social apps — into which it can inject more lucrative video ads. Training users to share the kind of content where ads can natively blend is really what Stories is all about. All video, all video ads None of this should be surprising. The company has previously publicly suggested its entire platform will be “all video” in the coming years. It’s also taken user-hostile design decisions such as removing the ability to send text messages from its main Facebook app. (And the aforementioned attempted rubbing out of text statuses in WhatsApp). So, basically, if you want to spam all your Facebook friends with a video of yourself wearing an animal selfie lens, Facebook will happily put all its tech at your disposal. But if you wish to swap a few words with people in your Facebook network, Facebook actively discourages that by requiring you switch to its Messenger app to do so. It’s very clear where the company’s priorities lie. Yet it remains to be seen whether Facebook users in general are going to be flocking in droves to engage in the kind of throwaway visual sharing Stories encourages — with the format effectively asking them to repackage private lives into what amounts to a self-promoting public ‘ad format’, complete with stickers, silly effects and so on. Thing is, for several years Facebook has had a problem with users posting fewer personal updates. This too is not surprising, given the network has something of an identity crisis these days. It’s certainly a far cry from the original concept of linking university friends across a campus. Instagram is obviously the more natural home for people with a love of visual sharing generally (including those who want to build public followings for what they share). While WhatsApp/Messenger are for communicating privately with friends and/or in more bounded groups. So the question arises, who is Facebook for? The people in the average Facebook network may well include a number of uni friends but also various family members, workmates across different jobs, folks you once met at a party, friends of friends, old school friends, professional connections and even random strangers. Such an assortment of ‘connections’ likely does not constitute either a close-knit group of friends nor a unified group of people with shared interests. The only loosely linking factor is they all (maybe) met you at least once in your life. Nor are Facebook friends likely to be a uniformly active network. I see huge variation in terms of content sharing in my own network, for example. It will undoubtedly take a certain type of person to want to blanket broadcast Stories across such a varied and variously segmented network. (Stories can be shared with specific Facebook friends only, but the default push for the format is clearly to encourage sharing with all.) The mask slips Anecdotally, a very small subset of my own Facebook connections also appear to account for the vast majority of personal updates still being shared. (Doubtless exacerbated by the algorithmic effect of the Facebook News Feed promoting posts that get more engagement). Could I imagine these most actively sharing Facebook users sharing Facebook Stories? Perhaps a few of them — so an even smaller subset. But the handful of users I see who are still regularly sharing personal stuff on Facebook appear to be doing so either to spark debate on a particular issue/topic; to entertain and/or garner public attention/likes; or to ask for (and in so doing share) information/advice with a group — functions that all feel secondary as far as Stories is concerned, given the emphasis here is squarely on visual entertainment. I may be wrong but it’s very hard to imagine serious or substantial topics being debated via Stories, what with all the selfie lenses, movie masks, and visual effects Facebook is touting…  Stories can also be posted to the Facebook News Feed. So there is at least the possibility that someone could use the format to try to garner comments in the usual way, by turning it into a standard piece of public Facebook content. But I can’t imagine how such a promotional format could sensitively touch on some of the topics I’ve seen discussed across Facebook in recent years, including very difficult issues like child abuse, depression and marriage breakdown. A selfie lens really isn’t going to fit.  \n",

            "Snapchat all the things! Facebook’s  plan to copy everything that made Snapchat successful is finally reaching its final form with the launch of stories in the main Facebook app. You can now share stories with your Facebook friends and see what your friends have been up to for the past 24 hours. At the top of the Facebook app, you’ll see rounded profile pictures representing stories by your friends. If you tap on one, it’ll open your friend’s story with photos, videos, drawings and camera effects. Essentially, Facebook is creating a second newsfeed for the mobile generation. It is swapping text and photo updates with visual communication because it feels more personal. Once you get access to stories, you’ll find a camera icon in the top left corner of the Facebook app. You can then take photos and pictures, add effects and drawings and share the result. After 24 hours, posts in your story disappear forever. Facebook is also adding new camera effects today. Facebook is introducing Direct as well, a new inbox for direct messages. It is reminiscent of Snapchat’s direct messages. This way, you can share photos and videos with one or multiple friends in particular, or reply to your friends’ stories. So Facebook has now added stories to all its main apps — Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp. While Instagram’s stories have been a huge success, let’s see if Facebook’s user base also wants to embrace the story format. Facebook Stories and Direct are rolling out today. You won’t necessarily see stories straight away, but they’re on their way.  \n",

            "Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants the company to own the future of virtual reality, and in the short term that means putting a lot of VR headsets on a lot of faces. Even for a company with nearly 2 billion monthly active users, hardware is still an incredibly difficult beast to master. To do so, the company is hiring Michael Hillman, a 15-year veteran of Apple, to lead the VR product roadmap for Oculus as head of VR hardware. An Oculus  spokesperson tells Bloomberg that Hillman will work closely alongside Oculus COO Hans Hartmann in his role. Oculus head of VR hardware Michael Hillman Hillman worked in senior engineering and design roles at Apple where he worked on products like the iMac. According to his LinkedIn, Hillman spent his final four years at Apple working in a confidential hardware role. Hillman is listed as an inventor on a number of Apple patents related to displays and battery technologies. Hillman left Apple in 2015, later joining Zoox, an autonomous vehicle startup. The organizational structure at Oculus has grown increasingly peculiar over the past few months, with the virtual reality company growing much closer to its parent company Facebook. In December, co-founder Brendan Iribe stepped down as CEO to lead the PC-based VR division. Unlike other siloed Facebook products, such as Instagram, Oculus will soon report directly to an executive in Zuck’s inner circle, the recently hired Hugo Barra, joining from Xiaomi to lead VR efforts. Hillman adds another degree of separation between Facebook’s top brass and the original Oculus co-founders, a group that has recently been divided into organizationally separate mobile and PC-based hardware teams. While former Oculus CTO John Carmack and Chief Software Architect Michael Antonov are now working on the mobile team’s software advances, Iribe and former VP of Product Nate Mitchell are separately leading efforts on the PC-based Rift hardware. With Hillman coming aboard as head of VR hardware, it’s worth noting that Oculus has already shown prototypes that look beyond its current Mobile/PC-based org structure. At the company’s OC3 developer’s conference late last year, Oculus gave press previews of “Santa Cruz,” its wirelessly tracked all-in-one prototype headset. An Oculus executive told TechCrunch that the company’s standalone headset was being developed under a separate team outside of the PC-based hardware division. The company’s current flagship virtual reality device, the Oculus Rift headset, was released one year ago with more than a healthy amount of delays caused by manufacturing issues, something that caused quite a bit of anger among early adopters who were already upset by the headset’s higher-than-expected $599 price tag. The company released its Touch motion controllers for the Rift in December and last month slashed the prices of both the controllers and headset by $100.  \n",

            "323 Facebook officially launches “Town Hall” for contacting government reps, adds local election reminders\n",
            "Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported Facebook was rolling out a new feature called “Town Hall,” which would allow the social network’s users to easily locate, follow and contact their local, state and federal government representatives. The company today confirmed the feature is available to all U.S. users on desktop and mobile, and will now include News Feed integration. Along with this news, Facebook  also announced it’s launching local election reminders for the first time, to encourage users to vote in state, county, and municipal elections. The changes follow Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent penning of a nearly 6,000-word manifesto where he discussed a number of ambitions for the social network in the days ahead. One of these was focused on using the network to increase civic engagement – a tacit acknowledgement of the role Facebook plays in today’s political landscape. Following the U.S. presidential elections, the company was accused of helping Donald Trump win, by doing nothing to prevent the spread of fake news and disinformation across its network. Its algorithms which show users more of what they like to keep people in the app longer were also blamed for keeping people in “bubbles” where they believe that everyone thinks the same way they do, increasing polarization. Zuckerberg initially downplayed the concerns over the spread of “fake news” on Facebook by saying that the network was a technology platform, not a media company. He later changed his position on this, and the company has since begun rolling out a variety of fact-checking measures to combat fake news. In the letter, Zuckerberg also said he wanted Facebook to focus on increasing civic engagement in a world where “participation in voting sometimes includes less than half our population.” With the addition of “Town Hall,” Facebook took a step towards this goal. The feature makes it simpler for users to know who represents them in government, and reach out through whichever means the politician lists on their Facebook page. The feature was recently made available in the “More” menu on mobile and on desktop to a subset of users. When you launch it, you would be presented with a list of reps at the local, state and federal level, and you could click to visit their Facebook page or send them a message, call them, or email. Not all reps offer their contact information via Facebook, however. And Facebook doesn’t yet pull in the missing phone numbers or emails from off-site sources, like official government websites, for example. The company tell us that’s something it wants to address in time, though. Today, Town Hall is available to all U.S. Facebook users and some of its features will now be integrated in the News Feed.  If you like or comment on a post made by one of your elected officials, a new feature below the comments will invite you to call, message or email the rep. After doing so, users will then be prompted to share a post saying that they contacted the rep, as a means of encouraging their friends to do the same. Facebook says that this Contact Your Rep post is not shown to everyone, but only to those who are also already engaging with an elected official’s post, through a like or comment.  But Facebook likely made this decision in an effort to keep its News Feed from becoming too politicized. It could anger those who would interpret these shares as Facebook itself directing them to take a specific political action. Additionally, Facebook says it will now offer Election Reminders for local elections. The company has already been running reminders at the top of the News Feed for national elections since 2008 – something it says has increased voter turnout. Here, Facebook cited its own internal research and a study in the Nature journal, which had found that its 2010 message impacted real-world turnout by 340,000 votes.  To make this feature possible, Facebook had to upgrade its civic data infrastructure to automate the reminders for thousands of elections across the U.S., it says. The new, local election reminders will appear for all state, county, and municipal elections in the U.S. in areas with a population of over 10,000 people, and will include both primaries and general elections. All three features are publicly available as of today on web and mobile. Image credit, top: Marcbela (Marc N.

            "324 Facebook Messenger now lets you privately share your Live Location for an hour\n",
            "Facebook  Messenger wants to be an offline social gathering tool, not just an online chat app. Today it’s adding a new Live Location feature that lets you share for an hour within a private direct or group message thread your real-time location on a map. The recipients can then see an estimate of how long it would take you to reach them by car. “Live Location is super helpful when trying to coordinate with friends, telling people how close you are when you’re on your way to an appointment or even sharing where you are with your roommate when you’re on your way home at night,” writes the feature’s product manager Selena Wang. It’s rolling out for all iOS and Android Messenger users today. Messenger could now challenge location apps like Foursquare Swarm and meetup apps like Down To Lunch.  Live Location is Facebook’s second big attempt at maps in Messenger after its first one blew up into a privacy scandal and was scrapped in 2015. Many users were sharing their momentary exact location with each message, which a Harvard student found could be scraped into a Marauder’s Map through a Chrome extension he built showing exactly where a friend had been. Facebook rescinded the student’s internship offer, made him take the extension down and switched to only letting users send their one-time current or future location. That static location feature is still available, but now there’s Live Location, too. This time, though, you can’t leave it on by default. Head of Messenger David Marcus posted that “Many of us make plans on Messenger that involve finding each other, or letting friends and loved ones know we’re on the way. Sharing your location will also help some of you feel safer on the way home.”  To use Live Location: Of course, battery life is a big issue with location features as GPS can drain your device’s energy quickly. But Facebook tells me it feels confident that Live Location uses a standard amount of battery, and Marcus writes “We put a lot of time and effort into … minimizing battery consumption to the point you wouldn’t even have to think about it.” Though it’s still worth keeping an eye on it. Alongside the Active Now status indicators and Messenger Day’s “Who’s up for?” filters, Messenger is becoming a much more full-featured utility for getting together with friends. That could give it an advantage over strict chat products and dedicated visual communication apps. Offline gathering is still a largely unsolved problem. It’s tough to know who is available to hang out and close enough for that to be convenient. To win in this space, a product needs social graph ubiquity, location sharing, to be a place users already check frequently and to have a messaging component for planning. Swarm, Down To Lunch and a graveyard of other apps have always missed a critical piece. But as I wrote last year, Messenger could succeed because it piggybacks on Facebook identity and is already where people are organizing meetups. For all our fancy apps, we still need a way to fight the loneliness and get face to face in person. Remember, though, now if you say “on my way” you better not be lying while still home in your pajamas.  \n",

            "The race is on to attract as much expertise in artificial intelligence as possible at tech companies large and small, and more than a few Silicon Valley giants are looking inward to convert tech talent they already possess into the AI resources they increasingly need. Facebook  has its own AI course, which is oversubscribed, according to a new report by Wired, and which is led by one of the leading AI researchers in the world. Facebook’s Larry Zitnick, who is a key leader at the social networking company’s Artificial Intelligence Research Lab, as well as a Microsoft Research and CMU Robotics alum, teaches a class on deep learning for Facebook employees that draws over-capacity crowds. Zitnick’s course sparks strong competition among engineers who already rank among the best in the world, each vying to come to grips with and excel at a field outside of their original purview, but one that few fail to recognize is the hottest in tech. On the other hand, AI and deep learning increasingly touch all aspects of the technology business, so experts with understanding of where the overlap might prove most useful in their own original discipline are also going to be very much in demand. There are external efforts underway to help create more of these polyglot deep learning pros, including at online educational firms like Udacity, but new talent isn’t rolling in fast enough from outside sources, traditional and non-traditional alike. Facebook also offers an AI immersion program, which embeds prospects within the work it’s doing in the field. The goal, again, is to spread expertise across the company, and thread deep learning know-how into the organization’s very DNA. Expect this to be the rule for big tech company behavior for the foreseeable future.  \n",

            "After years of stubborn caution, Facebook  is finally embracing the animated GIF. Next week Facebook will begin testing a GIF button that lets users post GIFs from services like Giphy and Tenor as comments, a source told TechCrunch. We inquired with Facebook, which confirmed the GIF test is coming with this statement: “Everyone loves a good GIF and we know that people want to be able to use them in comments. So we’re about to start testing the ability to add GIFs to comments and we’ll share more when we can, but for now we repeat that this is just a test.” At first this GIF comment button will only be available to a small percentage of Facebook users, but it could roll out to everyone if it proves popular. It will work similarly to the GIF button in Facebook Messenger, allowing users to both browse trending GIFs and search for specific reactions in-line. Users still won’t have the ability to select and share GIFs as News Feed posts, but comment GIFs could lay the groundwork for that. Facebook’s GIF comments button will work similarly to GIFs in Facebook Messenger, seen here   Facebook has long shirked the animated image medium. The rationale was that allowing flashy, eye-catching GIFs might distract from the rest of the News Feed experience. Facebook has even reportedly had support for GIFs built for years, but delayed rolling it out for fear of disrupting the feed aesthetic. That was before Facebook News Feeds filled up with auto-play video. Eventually Facebook permitted News Feed sharing with the direct URL of a GIF file, but that meant users had to search for them on sites like Imgur or Tumblr, or host them themselves. Then Facebook only allowed Pages and ads to share GIFs. There was still no GIF browser and no uploading by users allowed. And all the while, Facebook’s feed downranked “low-quality memes,” which could include ‘image macros’ made up of a GIF + overlaid text. Messenger added GIF sharing back in 2015, but the main Facebook app still didn’t play nice with the format. This anti-GIF orthodoxy eventually began to hold Facebook back. Fellow content-browsing site Imgur has ridden GIF sharing to 150 million users, and BuzzFeed’s GIF listicles have been some of the most popular links leading people away from Facebook.  But now Facebook is diving headfirst into visual communication, following Snapchat’s lead as social media usage evolves from text statuses to rich media. Most of that focus has been on video. However, Facebook sees flexibility as crucial to keeping users from straying to other broadcast channels. If the test is well received, Facebook comment reels might soon be filled with ‘reaction GIFs’. These typically use a clip of a movie, television show, or cartoon to express the emotion of the user, from excitement to concern. And eventually, Facebook might loosen up and add a GIF button to the News Feed composer. After all, GIFs are just the best moments of video played on loop, and Facebook says video is its future.  \n",

            "327 Facebook introduces a new ad format — product-focused ‘collection’\n",
            "Facebook  is introducing a new ad format that should help retailers showcase their products. The last big addition to Facebook’s ad lineup came last year, with the launch of Canvas, a fast-loading, rich media ad. Like Canvas, a collection is created specifically for mobile, and seems designed to win users over in the Facebook app — before directing them to the advertiser’s mobile website. Facebook monetization director Maz Sharafi told me the goal with the collection format is “to really build a great new shopping experience for people and to help marketers really drive discovery and sales in mobile.” Collections are also designed to be easy for merchants to set up, with Facebook doing the heavy lifting of choosing the right products to showcase from the merchants’ broader catalog. Sharafi added that collections take advantage of a number of broader trends: The growth of mobile commerce and video, plus the increasing importance of fast performance on smartphones.  So the ad shows up in users’ News Feeds — it leads with a video or image, followed by four product images below. If someone taps on the ad, it opens up a broader catalog of up to 50 different products. Then if they tap on a specific product, they’ll go to the advertiser’s website or app to make the purchase. Sharafi said that while the advertiser can choose the initial four products that show up in a collection, the rest are automatically selected by Facebook, based on the merchant’s preferences and on user targeting, aiming to create an experience that’s “as relevant as possible for the consumer.” Facebook is also announcing a change to the way advertisers can measure their results. For units like collections and Canvas, it won’t just tell advertisers when someone clicks an ad — it will also measure outbound clicks, namely when someone clicks out of the ad to the business’ website. This will also be available to advertisers on Instagram.  \n",

            "328 Facebook Messenger rolls out mention alerts and message Reaction emoji\n",
            "Group chat will get a bit less chaotic with the global rollout of two Facebook Messenger features it was previously testing in Vietnam. Users can now @mention friends in a group chat to send them a special notification to reply to your message so they don’t miss it in a noisy thread. You just type @, then the person’s name or in-thread nickname, and the name will be highlighted and that person will get an alert. Meanwhile, Facebook  is bringing its News Feed Reactions to Messenger so you can reply by attaching a love, smile, wow, sad, angry, thumbs-up or thumbs-down emoji to a specific message. This way you’ll be able to simply express agreement, disagreement or an emotion about a particular message, even if a bunch of other messages have come in since. Tap and hold on a message to pull up the Reactions menu and select one. Everyone will see a counter of different reactions on the message, and you can tap that counter to see exactly who reacted how. Reactions work in one-on-one chats, too. The “Thumbs-down” Reaction could be interpreted as Facebook’s first real “Dislike button.” However, Facebook calls it a “No” Reaction and told me that since people often use Messenger for coordinating logistics, it wanted to add easy ways to vote for or against a proposed plan. TechCrunch first spotted and reported on a test of Messenger Reactions early this month, and also saw that users in Vietnam were trying out mentions. Reactions works very similar to iOS 10’s iMessage’s Tapback reactions launched in September, and Slack’s more expansive and long-standing emoji reaction selector. Messenger Reactions work the same as iMessage’s Tapback reactions that launched last year Doubling down on group chat is smart for Messenger at a time when it’s been criticized for injecting social media content broadcasting into the communication app via Snapchat Stories clone Messenger Day. Messenger actually started as a group chat app called Beluga before Facebook acquired it. With mentions and Reactions, Facebook could use its better group chat experience than SMS to win users from the status quo.  \n",

            "329 Facebook tests an enhanced local search and discovery feature offering business suggestions\n",
            "Facebook  is testing an enhanced local search feature that could see the social network creeping in on Google Maps, Foursquare and Yelp territory, TechCrunch learned and Facebook confirmed. Facebook users are now able to surface recommendations of nearby places – like “dinner nearby” or “bars nearby,” for example  – by entering a query in Facebook’s search box on the web or mobile. This returns a box in Facebook’s search results that include a list of relevant businesses, along with their ratings on Facebook, a map, as well as which friends of yours have visited or like the places in question. A spokesperson for Facebook confirmed the feature saying, “We’re testing a new way to discover where to go and what to do around you.” The company declined to share other information about the addition, including how long the test has been in progress. It’s possible some users have had this option for a much longer time, but others are only now gaining access or don’t have it at all, as is standard with Facebook’s tests. The feature itself isn’t immediately obvious because the place suggestions aren’t always the first search result. On the web, the map and list of recommendations often show up as you scroll a bit further down, below the results for posts from Groups, links, posts from friends, and Facebook Pages. But on mobile, the results are much closer to the top, if not the first item. (It varied depending on the query, in tests.)    The suggestions themselves are in a small box in the search results that includes a pink pin drop icon next to the heading, like “Shopping & Retail Nearby” or “Pizza Places Nearby” or whatever else you may have searched. Facebook is also prompting these searches via auto-complete suggestions from the search box. It’s unclear how Facebook determines which results to show you in the small box, as it’s seemingly not number of reviews, rating, or proximity to your current location that determines which places are shown first. Nor is it social data  – for instance, a place visited by over a dozen friends was returned below one visited by just a few. Beneath these initial suggestions, you can click “See all” to be taken to a fuller list.  In addition to standard information like the business’s name, address, phone number, and photos, Facebook displays how many people have rated the business, its star rating, pricing (as measured by one to four dollar signs), whether it’s open now, plus the above-mentioned social data about your friends’ visits and likes. Facebook is also using technology to parse users’ reviews in order to highlight what the business in question is known for, or what people talk about in their reviews. For example, a bakery’s review might say that “people talk about friendly service, vegan donuts and iced latte.” (Nope, Facebook’s tech doesn’t have a grip on proper grammar just yet.)  Plus, the business listings may have a call-to-action, as they do on their Page – like “Sign Up,” “Shop Now” or “Call Now,” for example. On the web version of the feature, you can filter the search results by price, places that are currently open, or other social metrics, like “visited by friends” or “good for groups.” Restaurants can also be narrowed down by cuisine (pizza, sushi, Chinese, etc.). And you can “Like” the business on both web and mobile.  Facebook is clearly taking advantage of its wealth of data on businesses and social metrics to build out this feature – an inevitable next step for the business, given the obvious opportunity for search ads. This is hardly the first time that Facebook has dabbled with serving up local business info, however. Way back in 2012, Facebook launched Nearby, following its acquisition of Foursquare competitor Gowalla. That feature did much of the same thing, and still exists in its present form from the “More” menu on mobile. The integration of “Nearby” suggestions in the search results seems more like an iteration on this earlier feature. But it adds functionality – like the calls-to-action and the algorithmically-parsed customer reviews – which makes it a bit more functional.  Above: Facebook Nearby, circa 2012 What’s interesting is that, despite everything Facebook knows about its users, the suggestions were not ranked as well as they could be. For instance, just because a lot of my fellow parents have hosted kids’ birthdays at Chuck E. Cheese, that doesn’t warrant the restaurant from getting top billing in a list of suggested pizza places. It also pushed a lacrosse uniform shop and the teen-focused Hot Topic to the top of its suggestions for “Women’s Clothing Stores Nearby.” Uh, no.  Above: various filters in the Nearby feature in search Either Facebook isn’t fully tapping into its data to make these suggestions, or its data alone is falling short. If the latter, it could use another infusion – like the data from Foursquare. Facebook had skipped over Foursquare years ago in favor of Gowalla. But today’s Foursquare is more powerful than the social check-in app of the past. Its database of locations is integrated into over 100,000 apps (including Snapchat), it offers businesses useful analytical data on foot traffic, it partnered with Nielsen to map digital ads in order to connect them to real-world traffic and sales, and it just rolled out a push notification-based recommendation engine to developers. It’s not hard to imagine how well these features would fit into Facebook given how closely they’re aligned with Facebook’s own goals. But Foursquare’s trouble with finding an exit has always been about its price and valuation. In the meantime, Facebook’s existing “Nearby” feature and this new local search addition pale compared with what Foursquare, Yelp or Google today offer consumers. It’s handy, I suppose, if you happen to be on Facebook, but it’s not worth launching Facebook for this alone when better options exist.

            "330 Facebook Live adds PC game and desktop live streaming\n",
            "Facebook  is taking a swing at Twitch while also one-upping its mobile live streaming video competitors. Today, all users can go Live directly from Facebook’s desktop website via their webcam, stream through professional equipment and software hooked up to a desktop and broadcast gameplay from their computer. Previously, Facebook had only allowed Pages to stream from their desktop, not users, and only had limited gameplay streaming partnerships with game developers like Blizzard. There will now be a Live button on the desktop status update composer.   The ability to use streaming hardware and software to broadcast straight to the News Feed could allow creators to add on-screen graphics, titles and overlays to make their streams more fancy and polished. Here’s a step by step guide to how connecting hardware or software to Facebook Live works. Opening up on desktop takes Facebook Live beyond Twitter and Periscope’s options, and brings it into competition with longer-running services like YouTube, Ustream and Livestream, as well as startups like YouNow. Facebook tells me it foresees desktop streaming to be useful for activities like Q&As and vlogging where holding your phone in your hand might be shaky and annoying for both creators and viewers.  Facebook’s aggressive push into live streaming indicates its goal of owning the verb “Live,” and being the place people broadcast when there’s something worth sharing. While Periscope launched first in April 2015, Facebook quickly moved to roll out Live and add a Live API for broadcasting from professional equipment. Periscope only added an API yesterday. Now with the desktop launch, Facebook is looking to be a ubiquitous broadcasting tool. While the content on Live might not be great yet, and there’s been some troubling broadcasts of violence that Facebook promises it’s working to prevent, it’s still early for the medium. If Facebook can lock-down the content type now, it could enjoy years of broadcasts that give it exclusive content to attract users to the News Feed and space to run lucrative video ad breaks. While mobile is always Facebook’s focus, adding desktop streaming means you can broadcast however you like.  \n",

            "331 Facebook rolls out seasonal greetings at the top of the News Feed\n",
            "Facebook’s  News Feed is getting a little more colorful today. Its “Goodwill” team — which is behind efforts like Friends Day and various messages at the top of the feed, including the recently added Weather greetings — is now rolling out new animations to denote the changing seasons. Starting today, people may begin to see an animated message with birds or butterflies denoting the first day of spring, if they’re in the Northern Hemisphere, or an animation of falling leaves, if in the Southern Hemisphere. The animations will only appear on mobile devices, including both iOS and Android. The animations were designed by Facebook’s internal team of artists and illustrators using cut paper, vector-based graphics and motion, the company says. They serve no other purpose beyond announcing the vernal or autumnal equinox, depending on which hemisphere you live in, except for making the News Feed a bit more cheery and giving users something to share. The larger goal of the Goodwill team is to create an environment on Facebook where people are “moved to express their feelings and connect with things that matter,” Facebook has explained in the past. That includes experiences like birthdays, anniversary videos and the “On This Day” feature, in addition to the messages that pop up at the top of the News Feed and other events that people are interested in sharing. The idea is to prompt users to click on the new greetings, which will trigger a Facebook post you can edit with your own message and content. The post will read you’re “welcoming spring” (or fall), and will include the larger seasonal graphic as part of the post. This may seem like a minor feature, but it’s part of a larger agenda to boost personal sharing on the network. According to reports from The Information and Bloomberg last year, people are sharing fewer personal posts with their friends on the social network, at a time when other apps like Snapchat and Instagram are expanding their reach. The Information said original sharing had dropped by 15 percent from the prior year, and Facebook specifically formed an internal team to improve this metric. (Facebook disputes this, saying that’s not “entirely the case.”) These News Feed greetings have become more a part of the Facebook experience in recent months, thanks to informational messages about the day’s weather, which helps Facebook replace yet another regular destination on users’ phones — their preferred weather application.  \n",

            "332 Facebook will never take responsibility for fake news\n",
            "M ark Zuckerberg is displeased. It’s been more than four months since election night, but Facebook still finds itself in the hot seat over the spread of fake news on the platform, and what role (if any) it played in the election. As part of a nationwide tour, Zuck expressed that Facebook doesn’t want fake news on the platform. Oh good! “There have been some accusations that say that we actually want this kind of content on our service because it’s more content and people click on it, but that’s crap,” said Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting in North Carolina last week. “No one in our community wants fake information. We are also victims of this and we do not want it on our service. “It’s not always clear what is fake and what isn’t,” he continued. “A lot of what people are calling fake news are just opinions that people disagree with.” This is just the latest in a long string of recent responses to the issue that shirk responsibility for the content that users consume and share on Facebook. I believe that Facebook does not want fake news on the platform, especially given the backlash. I also believe that Facebook isn’t the only party responsible; the media hackers and political groups that originally post it and the users who share it also have responsibility in the matter. But it’s hard to argue that Facebook does not want all the content. Facebook was built to foster engagement, and sensationalism (just one of the many forms of Fake News) encourages engagement. Facebook made itself the middle man of media, but has yet to take responsibility for that role and its influence.  Though the response after the election seems sprawling and elaborate, it comes only after a public outcry — Facebook itself admits that fake news has existed on the platform for years. And given these latest comments from Zuckerberg, which adds Facebook’s victimhood to a list of excuses and distractions that have comprised Facebook’s post-election response, it seems more clear that Facebook will never take any real responsibility for the veracity of the content pouring through the site.   n 2015, Facebook’s interest in the world of news became more overt with the launch of “Instant Articles,” keeping users on the Facebook platform instead of sending them to the outside web when they clicked on a link to an article. But the quest to conquer content distribution and consumption on the internet started well before then. Remember, Facebook used to have “a wall” and now it has a “News Feed.” Facebook has gradually built out its platform to serve publishers, whether it’s through analytics dashboards or Instant Articles or rich-media link previews, through Follow buttons or Verified pages or the Trending section of the News Feed. And, through no fault of its own, Facebook also happens to have a lot of eyeballs. Obviously, publishers became interested, and then hooked — with little power to negotiate against Facebook. Until December, the company took no responsibility for blurring media brands and news content to all look the same through Instant Articles. Facebook threw this site or that site up on the Trending section with little-to-no regard for the most accurate and trusted sources. And yet, former Facebook News Feed editors admitted to suppressing conservative stories and boosting left-wing content, which shows some awareness that Facebook could influence its users via the news that flows through the social network’s veins. Before the election, Facebook stuck with the party line: “We are a tech company, not a media company.” It wasn’t until after the election, after BuzzFeed exposed how influential Facebook’s fake news problem could have been, that Zuck started to change his tune. No president has ever represented the interest of 2 billion people, nor has anyone ever attempted to regulate the flow of information for a group so large and diverse, and take responsibility for their experience using the service. For that, Facebook will willingly play a role. But given the breadth of users and the depth of the problem, I highly doubt that Facebook will “move fast, break things.” Instead, Facebook is pushing half-hearted solutions and scapegoating the issue to other parties, prepping to weather this storm on an already-laid foundation of media dependence and habit. November 10, 2016 Zuckerberg’s initial reaction, two days after the election, was to diminish fake news on Facebook as an issue: “Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook — of which it’s a small amount of content — influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” said Zuckerberg at the Techonomy conference. “I do think there is a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could’ve voted the way they did is fake news.” That fails to account for the fact that more than half of U.S. adults get their news from social media, and that most students have trouble distinguishing fake news from real news and that 20 percent of social media users say that they modified their stance on a social or political issue because of content seen on social media. November 12, 2016 Zuckerberg then recalibrated his language with a post on Facebook, sticking with the idea that it’s highly unlikely fake news affected the outcome of the election: <blockquote>This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully though. Identifying the “truth” is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.</blockquote> There are a few glaring problems with this. The first was explained well by my colleague Lora Kolodny in this post: “Zuckerberg’s comment draws a false equivalency between “mainstream sources” of news (including TechCrunch) and political groups masquerading as news brands.” The second issue is that Zuckerberg is holding to the idea that Facebook can not take full responsibility for the content, only the pipes. November 18, 2016 Zuckerberg’s third reaction (also posted to his Facebook page) added specifics about how the company plans to combat fake news, revealing under-construction features like stronger detection, easier reporting, third-party verification, warning labels, elevating the quality of “related articles,” disrupting the economics of fake news and “listening.” In the post, he lamented that the issue of fake news is both technically and philosophically complicated. On that, he’s right. Determining the truth is more complicated than an algorithm can handle. On December 5, anti-fake news features started to trickle out, including a survey that asked users to rate articles for their use of “misleading language.” The company didn’t clarify the survey when asked for comment, but it seems like the company was using it as a tool to gauge how users themselves decipher real news from clickbait and straight-up fakery. TC writer Devin Coldewey put it well: \n",
            "Furthermore, because users are the ones propagating the fake news to begin with, it’s a curious decision to entrust them with its classification. The inmates are being invited to run the asylum, it seems, or at least there’s going to be a bit of A/B testing.\n",
            " The company then announced new partnerships with fact-checkers from trusted organizations like Snopes, FactCheck.org, Politifact, ABC News and the AP, which is admittedly a step in the right direction. “We’re not looking to get into the gray area of opinion,” Facebook’s VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri told TechCrunch at the time. “What we are focusing on with this work is specifically the worst of the worst — clear hoaxes that were shared intentionally, usually by spammers, for financial gain.” This crosses off the list in one fell swoop a few of Zuck’s promises — making fake news less visible (stronger detection), append warnings, easier hoax reporting and disruption of the spam news economy. But still, it neglects to take on any extra editorial responsibility beyond the bare minimum, which in this case put the responsibility on third-party organizations. To be fair, they’re most certainly better equipped to do this job. But without admitting that Facebook is the front page and Zuck the editor, there is no way for Facebook to take a proactive (rather than reactive) approach to the fake news problem. December 21, 2016 But then, Zuck budged. After six weeks of touting Tools and Other People as the solution, Zuckerberg tweaked the message. “Facebook is a new kind of platform. It’s not a traditional technology company,” said Zuck. “It’s not a traditional media company. You know, we build technology and we feel responsible for how it’s used.” \n",
            "Pure technology platforms receive greater immunity regarding the content they serve, both legally and in the public eye. This stems from the 1996 Communications Decency Act’s Section 230(c), or the Good Samaritan act, that states “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” Media companies are considered more directly responsible for their content.\n",
            " January 6, 2017 A new year, a new approach. Facebook rang in 2017 with a new hire — former television anchor and charter school advocate Campbell Brown joined the company to lead Facebook’s News Partnerships team. Notice that Brown joined as head of News Partnerships. Notice how a high-profile broadcast anchor is leading a team that is working primarily on the digital distribution of news. No disrespect to Brown, but her appointment feels more like an appeasement to those who are calling for a public editor on Facebook, and instead are getting (at best) a liaison between the opaque Facebook News Feed and actual editors in actual newsrooms. At worst, critics are getting front-row tickets to see a prop in the theater of Facebook’s PR machine. The company clarified that Brown would not be taking on an editorial role or setting content policy for the company. No dip. January 11, 2017 This is where Facebook really starts to add insult to injury. The company unveiled “The Journalism Project,” which is a combination of a few great initiatives to combat fake news and good old-fashioned bribery. Some pieces of the Journalism Project — plans to work more closely with local news; hackathons where Facebook’s engineers and news site developers can work together; promotion of news literacy; and helping with eyewitness media — are steps in the right direction, vague as they may be. But the good is packaged in with business proposals, like digests of Instant Articles, free trials for subscription outlets, training for newsrooms on Facebook’s journalism tools and free analytics tools for journalists to see which news stories are trending. Let’s remember that Instant Articles are a big part of the problem, blurring the line between the content and the source of the content. Tools that expand Instant Articles or help paid news outlets offer free trials through Facebook only expand the practice of Instant Articles and grow the media’s dependency on Facebook for views. Tools, like Signal, which help journalists see stories that are trending, sound attractive. But the popularity of a news story doesn’t necessarily correlate with whether or not it deserves to be covered. Writing for clicks is very different from writing to inform the public, which shows how deeply Facebook misunderstands the problem altogether. Mid-January to mid-February 2017 In the month following the announcement of the Journalism Project, Facebook took action. The company rolled out anti-fake news features in Germany and partnered with Google to help combat fake news in the French election. Facebook executives also went before the public and discussed the situation. At a panel at UC Berkeley, VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri outlined ways to mitigate the spread of fake news, including retroactively notifying a user when they’ve consumed or shared something that has been flagged. Head of partnerships Dan Rose appeared onstage at Code Media in early February and touted the new party line: Facebook is a “new type of platform… where people discover a lot of media content.” He also said that “at the end of the day, if people want to share stories that have been flagged with their friends, that’s ultimately their prerogative.” Essentially, more of the same “it’s not our fault” but “we’re definitely working on it.” February 16, 2017 Just over three months after the election, Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook to post a 5,700-word manifesto that was full of warm fuzzies, buzzwords (but not the unflattering ones) and very little substance or coherence. Zuck’s diary didn’t go into much detail regarding the fake news problems on Facebook, but it did make an effort to defend the social network. Our own Taylor Hatmaker did a great job breaking it down: \n",
            "Zuckerberg suggests that providing a “range of perspectives” will combat fake news and sensational content over time, but this appears to naively assume users have some inherent drive to seek the truth. Most social science suggests that people pursue information that concerns their existing biases, time and time again. Facebook does not have a solution for how to incentivize users to behave otherwise.\n",
            "Even if we’re friends with people like ourselves, Zuckerberg thinks that Facebook feeds display “more diverse content” than newspapers or broadcast news. That’s a big claim, one that seems to embrace Facebook’s identity as a media company, and it’s not backed up by anything at all.\n",
            "Facebook explains that its approach “will focus less on banning misinformation, and more on surfacing additional perspectives and information.” For fear of backlash, Facebook will sit this one out, pretty much.\n",
            "Zuckerberg thinks the real problem is polarization across not only social media but also “groups and communities, including companies, classrooms and juries,” which he clumsily dismisses as “usually unrelated to politics.” Basically, Facebook will reflect the systemic inequities found elsewhere in society and it shouldn’t really be expected to do otherwise.\n",
            "Zuck “[wants] to emphasize that the vast majority of conversations on Facebook are social, not ideological.” By design, so are the vast majority of conversations Facebook has about Facebook. The company continues to be terrified of appearing politically or ideologically aligned.\n",
            " n his comments this week, Zuckerberg seemed to take a measured approach to address his accusers: “We need to make sure that we don’t get to a place where we’re not showing content or banning things from the service just because it hurts someone’s feelings or because someone doesn’t agree with it – I think that would actually hurt a lot of progress.” Being the “arbiter of truth” is not something that should fall on a single organization, nor is it simple to balance that arbitration across 2 billion users, across a multitude of cultures and beliefs and who are using a product that is fundamentally geared toward fostering that feedback loop — read this, like this, share this, see more of this. And it’s certainly not easy to do any of that while trying to run an advertising business. One of the accusers Zuck may be referencing is former product designer Bobby Goodlatte, who said: “Sadly, News Feed optimizes for engagement. As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.” Fair point. Complicating matters more is the fact that everyone experiences Facebook differently, based on that all-knowing algorithm. The New York Times has the same front page, across all users, every single day. There is only one New York Times, and you can take it or leave it. A Facebook user, on the other hand, may see an entirely different front page across a variety of sources and a range of topics that is completely different from another Facebook user. Add to that a president who has declared the media the enemy and it’s hard to blame Zuck for not wanting to get his hands dirty. Fake news is not easy to remedy. But before Facebook, there was no website that was home to 2 billion users. There was no ‘connected world’ the way we know it today. And it rests at the feet of Facebook to be accountable for the way its technology has changed the way we consume information.  Many smart people have suggested a public editor, but it would take an army to wade through the troves of content on Facebook with the same meticulous eye as a real news editor. Fortune’s Matthew Ingram put it well: \n",
            "Depending on whom you believe, the problem of fake news on Facebook is either one of the most important issues facing mankind, or an over-blown controversy pumped up by the mainstream media. And in a way, that dichotomy itself points out the problem with defining — let alone actually getting rid of — “fake news.”\n",
            "When someone uses that term, they could be referring to one of a number of different things: It might be a story about how Bill and Hillary Clinton murdered several top-level Washington insiders, or it might be one about how Donald Trump’s chief adviser is a neo-Nazi, or it might be one about how the most important election issue was Clinton’s emails.\n",
            "The first of these is relatively easy to disprove just by using facts. The second is somewhat more difficult to rebut, since a lot of it is based on innuendo or implication. And the third is almost impossible to respond to because it is pure opinion.\n",
            " Ingram suggested that, instead of a public editor, Facebook may implement some sort of Wikipedia-style crowdsourced truth filter. But suggestions aside, the first step toward solving the problem is Facebook taking responsibility for the problem, even if it’s just in part. And thus far, the company has yet to fully admit anything other than it’s not the arbiter of truth, it isn’t responsible for what it’s users post, and that despite that lack of accountability, the company is taking steps toward a remedy through growing the media’s dependence on Facebook as a platform. Both as a business decision and as a matter of moral responsibility, the company is in a difficult position. This is why I think we’ll never see Facebook admit that it’s a media company; that it has a responsibility for the content shared on its service; or make any legitimate moves that would suggest that Facebook is accountable for what you see on Facebook. Based on the company’s response over the last four months, it’s starting to seem like we’ll get more of the PR runaround than an actionable, achievable solution. Facebook and media publishers have grown their audiences together, but this particular issue has left them at an impasse. Publishers are calling for further action to stop the spread of fake news, which stands to discredit the whole lot of us, without taking a stand about sharing content through Facebook. And even if Facebook made moves toward filtering content, the media would undoubtedly hold it accountable for any mistake. “Censorship!” they’ll cry. Meanwhile, Facebook will continue to insist that it’s the publishers’ problem, the users’ problem or the fact-checkers’ problem before they actually do something meaningful to solve the problem. After all, the first step is admitting that you have one. “Move fast, break things” may have gotten us to this place, but that’s in the past now. “Be still, maybe it won’t see us” is the future.  \n",

            "333 Facebook Stories, yet another Snapchat clone, is rolling out to more countries\n",
            "Facebook is giving another feature that clones Snapchat Stories a big push. Facebook Stories, a feature that puts photos that disappear after 24 hours at the top of the Facebook mobile app, is rolling out to users in Chile, Greece and Vietnam, Facebook confirmed. However, it is not available to users in all markets. The feature was first tested among users in Ireland in January and its extension this week comes hot on the heels of a major Facebook offensive to bake Snapchat’s core features into its main mobile services. Messenger Day was launched inside the Messenger app last week, targeting the app’s one billion-plus monthly users with a feature that frustrated many by sitting right at the top of the app. Having already introduced similar features in WhatsApp in February and Instagram last year, Facebook is applying its Snapchat cloning to its main mobile app, which accounts for most of the 1.7 billion people who use Facebook on mobile each month. The next Snapchat killer? Facebook has started implementing stories on their app. IG stories took most of the users of Snapchat. pic.twitter.com/jpyK7pGUhA — Neil Enore (@neilenore) March 15, 2017  Facebook stories are stupid. If I wanted to let random people I added in year 8 know what I'm up to,I would have just added them on snapchat — Märiam (@mariamdiabyy) March 15, 2017  you've got to be kidding, FACEBOOK STORIES ARE A THING NOW. kill me — jordy🌷 (@RuckerJordan) March 15, 2017  I wrote last week that Facebook has gone too far with its efforts to throw Snapchat’s core functionality into WhatsApp and Messenger since it doesn’t match with the appeal or usage of either service. Facebook’s core mobile app could be different. People are expecting to see images inside the social network, but the concept of 24-hour disappearing photos may be new to many of those 1.7 billion mobile users who don’t use Snapchat or Instagram Stories. On the subject of Instagram,  Facebook looks to be enjoying considerably more success with Instagram Stories, its take on Snapchat inside the photo sharing service. The feature has reached 150 million daily users, according to Facebook, which makes it the same size as Snapchat, while it also appears to have stolen users and high-profile influencers from Snapchat, too. The focus of Instagram is visual content and a large chunk of the audience is young people, so there seems to be overlap with Snapchat and significant growth potential. That said, many people remain unconvinced that Facebook’s Snap-cloning in WhatsApp  and Messenger is a positive addition. Note: An earlier version of this post stated that Facebook Stories was rolling out to a selection of users worldwide. Facebook has since confirmed that the expansion is to three more countries.  \n",

            "334 Facebook’s new ‘Town Hall’ feature helps you find and contact your government reps\n",
            "In Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s nearly 6,000-word manifesto published last month, he laid out a number of global ambitions he had for the social network in the days ahead — including one where its users became more “civically-engaged” and voted more often. Now it seems Facebook has taken its first steps toward making that possible, through a new feature it’s calling “Town Hall.” This latest addition has just popped up on the “More” menu in Facebook’s mobile app, and offers a simple way for users to find and connect with their government representatives on a local, state and federal level.    To use Town Hall, you only have to enter your address — which Facebook says is not displayed or shared (though it doesn’t say it’s not “saved,” so be advised). We understand this information will be used to power future civic engagement products, like finding a polling place or previewing a ballot. This information will help populate the following screen with a list of your representatives, all of whom you can follow with just a click of a button. The list includes not just those representing you in the U.S. House and Senate, but also your state legislature and your governor, local council members and your mayor, as well as those in other federal positions, like VP Mike Pence and President Trump.  The list you’ll see will be based on your location, which means you might not have local reps appear — for example, if you live in a smaller town where local officials don’t maintain a Facebook presence. In addition to being able to follow their Facebook Pages in order to receive their updates in your News Feed, each representative also has a “Contact” button next to their name. When tapped, you have the option to “Message” them, “Email” them, or visit their Facebook Page. Of course, not all representatives are as available as others. In many cases, there may be no means of contact beyond visiting a Facebook Page.  On their Page, you may be able to dig around to find a phone number or mailing address, if it happens to be published. However, this is definitely not as handy as some of the independent websites that provide this information to you with just a few clicks, including the newer resistance-focused services like Call to Action or 5 Calls, for instance, or even other mobile apps, like Countable. It would be great to see Facebook enhance its Town Hall resource with the full contact details for all officials going forward, especially given that this is public information and fairly easy to find, even on official government websites. Beyond following your reps and getting in touch, the Town Hall feature applies a bit of peer pressure to get you involved by noting how many of your friends have connected with a government rep via Facebook. This isn’t all that useful beyond the potential psychological impact it has on users, by making them not want to be left out.  At the bottom of the page, you can also toggle voting reminders off or on, so you’ll be alerted when there’s an upcoming election in your area. Town Hall is hardly Facebook’s first foray into politics. The social network has regularly prompted users to register and vote through a number of means, including push notifications, banners in its News Feed, Messenger integrations, maps to polls, social sharing features (like “I voted”) and more — including, in this past presidential election, an “Election 2016” shortcut in users’ Favorites section on both web and mobile. It also published a voter guide, which included down-ballot propositions and local races. We’ve asked Facebook for more details as to the status of the Town Hall feature’s rollout, and Facebook responded with the following statement: “Town Hall is part of our ongoing work to support civic engagement on Election Day and every day. It is a dedicated space for people who want to learn about and participate in the political process.” The feature’s arrival follows several other recent additions to Facebook’s sidebar in recent months, including its new City Guides, Wi-Fi Finder, Discover People section and Weather guide.

            "335 Facebook, Twitter still failing on hate speech in Germany as new law proposed\n",
            "Facebook and Twitter  have once again been criticized in Germany for failures to promptly remove hate speech being spread via their platforms. At the same time, the German government has presented a draft bill aimed at more effectively combating hate criminality and criminal offenses on social network platforms, arguing that the companies’ ongoing failures necessitate tighter regulation — with a potential fine of up to €50 million being floated for social networks breaching what are intended to be binding standards for dealing with complaints and removing criminal content. As with many EU countries, Germany has specific hate speech laws that criminalize certain types of speech, such as incitement to racial violence. The issue has stepped up the domestic political agenda in the country in recent years, following the refugee crisis — with Germany taking in a large number of asylum seekers. The country also has elections this year, heightening concern over the role social media can play in shaping and influencing public opinion. “There can be just as little space in the social networks as on the street for crimes and slander,” said Federal Justice and Consumer Protection Minister, Heiko Maas, in a statement today (translated from German via Google Translate). “The biggest problem is that the networks do not take the complaints of their own users seriously enough.” Back in December 2015, Facebook and Twitter gave a commitment to the German government that they would remove criminal hate speech from their respective platforms within 24 hours. Google also agreed to do so on YouTube. Last May, Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft also all agreed with the European Commission on a code of conduct that committed to removing hate speech within 24 hours. However, in the latest German government-funded study monitoring the performance of the companies, the Ministry of Justice said Facebook has become worse at promptly handling user complaints, saying the company deleted or blocked 39 percent of the criminal content reported by users — a seven percentage point decline versus the first test of its performance. In addition, only one-third of content reported by Facebook users was deleted within 24 hours of the complaint being made, according to the survey. Twitter’s performance is also criticized, with the survey finding that only one of a hundred user messages had been erased, and none of the deletions took place within 24 hours. The pair’s failings also contrast negatively with Google, which is reported to have made significant improvements regarding YouTube  content complaints since the tests began — with the study finding that 90 percent of user-reported criminal content was deleted from the platform, and 82 percent of the deletions occurred 24 hours after the notification. “Google shows with the platform Youtube that it is better,” said Maas. “Therefore, it is now clear that we must further increase the pressure on social networks. We need legal regulations to make companies even more obligated to eradicate criminal offenses.” We reached out to Facebook and Twitter  for comment on the findings. Twitter declined to make a statement but a spokesman said the company has made changes in the past few weeks aimed at reducing the spread of abusive content on its platform which may not have been in place at the time of the survey. However, these tweaks appear most focused on using technology to try to automatically identify abusive/problem accounts, or give more tools to users to enable them to filter their own feeds, rather than putting more resource into content complaint processes specifically. (Although Twitter does claim to have improved the transparency of the reporting process, such as notifying users when a complaint has been received and if it is being acted upon.) At the time of writing, Facebook had not responded to our questions, but we’ll update this story with any response. Update: In an emailed statement a spokesperson for the company said: “We have clear rules against hate speech and work hard to keep it off our platform. We are committed to working with the government and our partners to address this societal issue. By the end of the year over 700 people will be working on content review for Facebook in Berlin. We will look into the legislative proposal by the Federal Ministry of Justice.” Responding specifically to criticism that it does not take user complaints seriously enough, Facebook said it has changed its internal procedures for interpreting its community standards guidelines in recent months, and has also provided specific guidance for its Community Operations (CO) team regarding hate speech in Germany. It also said it has “invested heavily” in the CO team — both globally and locally in Germany. By the end of 2017, Facebook says it will have more than 700 employees working with content moderation partner Arvato, based in Berlin. It also disputes the result of the German government-funded survey (which was carried out by jugendschutz.net), saying the results “do not mirror our internal experience and tests by independent organizations such as FSM” — claiming the latter’s tests of its processes found the opposite: a significant improvement in removing illegal content. (An FSM test based solely on user flagging from January found 65 percent of illegal content was removed from Facebook within 24 hours, and overall it had a deletion rate of 80 percent, according to Facebook.) “We do not believe that the results of the current jugendschutz.net tests reflect the progress we have made in improving our systems and will analyze this test thoroughly,” Facebook said, adding: “Obviously, we are disappointed by the results and we would like to thank Jugendschutz.net for testing our systems and will study all the reports carefully to help us improve the way we operate. We have clear rules against hate speech and work hard to keep it off our platform. We are committed to working with the government and our partners to address this societal issue.” Last week Facebook also came under fire in the U.K. for content removal failures pertaining to child safety, after a BBC investigation found the platform failed to promptly respond to the vast majority of reports the journalist made. The news agency had been checking Facebook’s own claims of improved performance after an earlier BBC investigation unearthed secret Facebook groups being used to share child abuse imagery. But it concluded that Facebook had failed to improve over the past year. Facebook is also facing continued pressure for how its platform is misappropriated to spread so-called “fake news” — an issue that has gained prominence in the wake of the U.S. election when large numbers of bogus political stories were seen to have circulated via the platform — potentially influencing how Americans voted. CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially tried to shrug off the issue, before conceding at the turn of the year that the billion+ user platform does indeed have “a greater responsibility than just building technology that information flows through.” Since December, Facebook has been piloting a series of measures aimed at fighting the spread of fake news problem, including in Germany since January, working there with local third-party fact-checking organization Correctiv to try to identify and flag dubious content. However, early signs are that Facebook’s efforts on the fake news front are not too promising either, with Recode reporting earlier this month that it took the platform a full week to label one made-up story as “disputed” — despite the source being a self-confessed fake newspaper. “Shouldn’t/couldn’t Facebook move faster on this stuff, especially when it’s a clear-cut case like this one? Yup! But that would require Facebook to make these kinds of (easy) calls on its own, and Facebook really doesn’t want to do that,” was Recode’s Peter Kafka’s conclusion of its performance there. Germany’s Maas also touches on the fake news issue, arguing that the proposed domestic law to tighten content complaint procedures for social media platforms will also help kill fake news. “We will not establish a commission of truth in a free society in which freedom of expression applies. But because the rules we propose are directed against the spread of criminal content, they are also a means against criminal ‘fake news,'” he said. “‘Fake News’ are punishable, for instance if they fulfill the facts of the offense, slander or the evil slander.” Among the proposals in the draft law are that social networks operating in Germany be obliged to: The obligation to delete or block criminal content reported by a user would also apply to all copies of the criminal content on the platform, under the proposals. The draft law would also require social network operators to report quarterly on the handling of complaints about content relevant to criminal law — including detailing the volume of complaints; their decision-making practices; and the “staffing and competence of the work units responsible for dealing with the complaints.” These reports would also have to be made accessible to the public online. Social networks that do not create an effective complaint management system capable of deleting criminal contents effectively and swiftly could be punished via fines of up to €5 million euros against the individual person responsible for dealing with the complaint, and larger fines of up to €50 million against the company itself. Fines also could be imposed if the company does not comply fully with its reporting obligation. The proposed law also would require social networks to appoint a “responsible contact person” in Germany who could be served in criminal proceedings and civil proceedings — and would themselves be on the hook for a fine of up to €5 million.  \n",

            "In response to pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union,  Color of Change and the Center for Media Justice, Facebook announced today that it will clarify its developer policy to explicitly prohibit the use of Facebook or Instagram  data in surveillance tools. The ACLU has revealed several instances of developers using information gleaned from Facebook’s APIs to create surveillance tools for law enforcement, and each time, Facebook has decided to revoke access to its data. In October, reporting by the ACLU uncovered the use of data from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter in the surveillance software Geofeedia, which culled protesters’ posts from the social media platforms and sold them to law enforcement. Twitter  also cut access last year to social media monitoring firms Snaptrends and Media Sonar, the latter of which tracked hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #IAmMikeBrown to identify activists. Facebook has contended that this kind of surveillance is already against its policies. But its policy was revamped today to state that developers can’t “use data obtained from us to provide tools that are used for surveillance.” Twitter made a similar declaration in November. “Our goal is to make our policy explicit. Over the past several months we have taken enforcement action against developers who created and marketed tools meant for surveillance, in violation of our existing policies; we want to be sure everyone understands the underlying policy and how to comply,” Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman wrote in a post announcing the adjustment. Facebook has cut ties with a few developers that make surveillance tools, and worked with several others to bring their apps into compliance with the policy. “Social media platforms are a powerful tool for Black people to draw attention to the injustices our community faces,” said Color of Change’s campaign director Brandi Collins. “We commend Facebook and Instagram for this step and call on all companies who claim to value diversity and justice to also stand up and do what’s needed to limit invasive social media surveillance from being used to target Black and Brown people in low-income communities.” But just because Facebook says surveillance is against the rules doesn’t mean that developers will listen. Right now, Facebook relies on automated and manual detection, as well as reports from users and advocacy groups like the ACLU on products that violate the policy. The ACLU, Color of Change and the Center for Media Justice say the next step is for Facebook to proactively enforce the policy, something Facebook argues it is already doing. “Facebook and Instagram should institute both human and technical auditing mechanisms designed to effectively identify potential violations of company policies, both by developers and their end users, and take swift action for violations,” the coalition said in a letter to Facebook. Developers are required to disclose what they plan to do with Facebook data, and the company reviews apps to make sure they comply. Facebook says it also conducts broad audits in some cases to ensure developers don’t misuse data.  \n",

            "Completing almost 8 years at Facebook,  Director of Product Management Peter Martinazzi has left the company. His last product, Messenger Day, shipped on Thursday. A Facebook “OG,” Martinazzi was well-liked and respected at the company. He worked with the growth team in some of Facebook’s breakout years before the IPO, and ran all of Messenger product during its modernizing 3.0 redesign in 2013. Goofy and casual, but with the zeal of a true believer in the mission of connecting people, Martinazzi always struck me as the emblematic Facebook staffer in my several interviews with him over the years. He could articulate lofty philosophy and intention behind social apps, yet drill into the logic behind tiny product decisions. Teammates celebrate with Peter (bottom left) in 2015 A Facebook spokesperson said about the departure, “Peter is so well-loved; he’s off to travel the world.” That’s understandable after enduring the fast pace of Facebook since 2009. Martinazzi tells me he still loves Facebook, and just had an itch to adventure outside of California. Facebook’s head of Messenger David Marcus wrote, “When I got to Facebook 2 1/2 years ago, Peter was running all of product for Messenger, and he already had a solid reputation across the company for hardcore execution skills, and amazing product chops . . . Conventional wisdom is that you learn from older people, who’ve had more experience. In this specific case though, I know for a fact I learned more from Peter than he learned from me.”  Martinazzi departs the company at a critical time for Messenger as it seeks to branch out from strict text messaging into visual communication, social media broadcasting, business interaction and e-commerce and become a third-party app platform. Martinazzi helped Messenger reach more than 1 billion users, developing a large lead over other Western messaging apps. But that also puts huge pressure on the app as a fundamental utility. The launch of Day and Messenger Camera complicate this, cluttering Messenger’s home screen with a shutter button and a Snapchat Stories clone. Some users have already expressed how they don’t want these features getting in the way of more utilitarian text messaging. Our writer Jon Russell succinctly sums up the case against Messenger Day and the same Snapchatification of WhatsApp with its new Status feature. On the other side of the argument is the fact that about 560 million photos are shared on Facebook Messenger every day, and it only just launched its revamped camera in December, and Day this week. People are already exhibiting this behavior, so why not make it easier to share these photos with lots of friends at once? Messenger clearly sees an opportunity to climb toward Snapchat’s 2.5 billion Snaps created per day. Now the Messenger team will have to react to and iterate on Messenger Day’s launch without Martinazzi. While Facebook eventually brought in more experienced executives like PayPal’s David Marcus and Stan Chudnovsky to run the Messenger unit, Martinazzi exemplified Facebook’s roots. In most companies, that would mean doing things they way they’d been done before. At Facebook, that means being willing to change whatever is necessary to adapt to how people share.  \n",

            "Explaining what VR is like can be a pretty daunting task. Today, Facebook and Oculus are making it a bit easier to share VR experiences with your friends and family. Alongside a host of social features, which also included the addition of a new events app and viewing of 360 videos in Oculus Rooms, today Oculus showed off an update to its Gear VR platform that will allow users to share live gameplay footage of their virtual reality sessions directly to Facebook.  The feature, which is launching to users outside of the U.S. today and will be released here in the States “in the coming weeks,” is meant to increase the visibility of VR content and allow people to better showcase to their friends what playing VR is like. This is only the latest Facebook integration into Oculus. Earlier this week, Facebook introduced their first VR app, Facebook 360, which serves as a home for the site’s 360-degree photos and videos. With these features, Facebook is better leveraging their community to increase access to VR and give users who haven’t tried it a better idea of what it’s all about. The other big announcement that Oculus made today is the addition of voice search to the Oculus Home platform on both Rift and Gear VR. This is a pretty key evolution and will make discovering content that much easier as the library of gaming titles and experiences grows in the storefront. Onscreen keyboards in VR are about the worst thing to navigate ever, so the addition of voice search will definitely assuage some user frustration. Oculus Voice, as they are calling it, will be launching with search support, but will likely evolve to support more digital assistant-like tasks, such as seeing if a friend is online or other contextual commands.  \n",

            "339 That time Facebook went too far\n",
            "Facebook’s attempts to clone Snapchat know no limit. The social networking giant is in the enviable position of owning a number of the world’s most used internet services and applications. Facebook the social network is closing in on two billion registered users — a level of global reach that is unprecedented in history — while its Messenger  app counts one billion active users. The company has invested wisely, and two of its acquisitions are equally as popular and international. WhatsApp  has more than a billion active users worldwide, predominantly in emerging markets, while Instagram reached 500 million users last summer and continues to grow fast across pretty much every part of the world bar China. Facebook is a once in a generation beast because it has the kind of scale that no other company has, or is ever likely to reach in this generation, at least. Through its growth it has laid out a tough standard for other social networks and services. The Facebook comparison has blighted Twitter and its failure to grow, for example, and it is weighing on the minds of investors in newly public firm Snap, too. Yet despite these achievements, Mark Zuckerberg and his team seem determined to out-snap Snap, the company he once tried to buy for $3 billion, by cloning its disappearing photo feature, the core of its app, into every piece of digital real estate that Facebook owns. That focus appears to be working for Instagram — which we reported is burrowing into Snap’s business in terms of both users and influencers — but Facebook’s relentless pursuit of all possible cloning opportunities has now officially gone too far. This week it launched Messenger Day for Facebook Messenger, having added a similar feature to WhatsApp last month. Messenger and WhatsApp, arguably its two prized jewels in today’s mobile-first messenger-centric world, have been Snap-cloned — and the results appear far from impressive. As someone living in a market where Facebook first tested Messenger Day — the Snapchat clone its executives refuse to acknowledge was copied from Snapchat — I can say that the new feature has only soured my use of Messenger.    Despite the fact that it sits atop the app with no option to hide or remove it, I’ve never seen more than three of my 600-plus Facebook friends from across Asia, Europe and the U.S. use it during a single day. Others I spoke to have seen a similar pattern of (lack of) usage. What’s worse is that Facebook has inadvertently brought people into this Snaptastic new world of photo sharing without their full knowledge. The constant prompts that pop up when you share an image inside a Messenger chat window have led to embarrassing accidental postings. One friend posted confirmation of a bank transfer, sent as confirmation to the receiver via Messenger, to “Messenger Day.” Because it wasn’t clear how to remove the image, he cringed all day as it sat there for all to see for 24 hours before finally disappearing. The feature just launched in the U.S., but already the signs don’t seem too encouraging. https://twitter.com/stevekovach/status/840043912072900608 Now that Facebook Messenger is trying to be Snapchat, I long for the days when it was trying to be WeChat. — Andreas Ehn (@ehn) March 10, 2017  messenger just became a shite Snapchat — Lee🇬🇧 (@LeeRafferty1872) March 10, 2017  \"Add to your day\" no thanks Facebook Messenger I use Snapchat to show people who shit my day is — Aodhán (@aodyjb) March 10, 2017  My god this was a bad idea. I'm certain Stories in my banking app are next. — M.G. Siegler (@mgsiegler) March 10, 2017  Beyond the Twitter crowd, young people — thought to be one of the the key targets of Facebook’s clone attempts — don’t seem to take the new Messenger Day feature very seriously. “My school friends think Facebook Day is ridiculous, and so do I,” Tiffany Zhong, a 20-year-old student who formerly worked at VC firm Binary Capital, told TechCrunch. “The sentiment around Facebook Day is clearly all negative unfortunately. But shoutout to Facebook for being relentless and shameless in replicating Snapchat!” she added. Zhong said she posted one photo on the new service captioned ‘What is this nonsense’ and was surprised to see that all the responses she got from her friends were negative. “Why is everything about creating stories now. i hate it lmao,” one told her. That’s not exactly the response Facebook HQ was hoping for. It isn’t just Messenger — the WhatsApp experience has been an equal disappointment. Few people I know on WhatsApp — many of whom are in India or other countries where it is the primary communications app — have used the new Snapchat Status feature. From conversations, most are unclear as to why they’d want to post self-destructing photos in the first place, while other more tech-savvy friends, perhaps influenced by Western internet culture, would rather post to a place where family and friends aren’t going to be on the receiving end of their photos. On the whole, the answer to that latter part is Snapchat, not WhatsApp or Messenger.  Beyond an effort to appeal to younger people who are reportedly ditching its service for places where their parents are not, Facebook’s Rest of the World theory on Messenger and WhatsApp seems to center on the fact that Snap has failed to build a meaningful presence in emerging markets. While it is true that Snap doesn’t have an emerging market focus — a source told TechCrunch there will be no Snapchat Lite because the company wants to reach a self-determined “quality” audience whether in the U.S., India or elsewhere — bolting these features into WhatsApp and Messenger is a hideous misunderstanding of dynamics of messaging which have Messenger and WhatsApp so popular. What about those who have used it? It was hard to track down a regular user, but Dan Clarke, CEO of SEO marketing agency Disruptient, is one. Despite living in Singapore, where WhatsApp is the dominant chat app, Clarke said his postings, which tended to be once a day, attracted just a handful of replies from friends on the service. “Typically, I’ll see three or four responses to a photo from several hundred contacts I have stored within the app,” he said. “But many of those contacts are people I meet through work or don’t know too well, so they may not be likely to reply to something this personal.” Clarke added that he was surprised that his photos are viewable by anyone whose phone number he had. In other words, a lot of people he might have forgotten about a long time ago. Clarke said he believes WhatsApp Status is still a novelty with some people, but he posts more content to Instagram Stories when given the choice between it, Snapchat and WhatsApp. Beyond young users and millennials, most people appreciate that both apps are a step up from SMS while keeping the same simplicity. An easy way to reach and chat with anyone. With its focus on images, there’s logic to bringing the Snapchat features to Instagram, but with WhatsApp and Messenger the thesis runs counter to their values. Facebook, to its credit, is focusing on other areas for its messaging apps. It is reportedly testing business services inside WhatsApp — which is already used unofficially for such purposes in places like India and the Middle East — while it recently altered its bot program to instead focus on app-like interfaces that have been hugely success for China’s WeChat, the bellwether for innovation in messaging. It remains to be seen whether Facebook will face backlash for its Snap-cloning inside WhatsApp and Messenger, but it certainly seems like an unnecessary risk to entertain when there is so much at stake in the future of messaging. WeChat has moved on to testing mini apps, turning its chat app into a cross-platform operating system of sorts. The end goal of chat looks like bringing utility and convenience to the fore rather than cloning a competing product into the fabric of every app under the sun.  \n",

            "As competition in the live streaming space heats up, Facebook  has scored a significant deal that will allow it to stream at least 22 live Major League Soccer matches on its social network. Through a collaboration with both MLS and Univision Deportes, Facebook gained the rights to stream the 2017 MLS regular-season matches in English, as well as enhance the video content with various interactive elements. The streams will include Facebook-specific commentators and interactive graphics, as well as fan Q&A and polling features that let Facebook viewers engage with the commentators as the matches take place. These are the same games that are being broadcast on Univision  networks in Spanish, but Facebook has scored exclusive rights to the English language streams. As a part of the deal, MLS will also produce more than 40 original “Matchday Live” analysis shows that will be posted to the MLS Facebook page. These shows will include feature highlights and discussions from around the league, as well as previews of the upcoming matches. The pilot episodes of “Matchday Live” ran on MLS Opening Weekend, and will be followed by another episode this weekend, at 4 PM ET.  The live streams of the games themselves will be on the Univision Deportes Facebook page, and will kick off with Atlanta United hosting the Chicago Fire on March 18 at 4 pm ET. The games will be available both on the desktop and mobile, via the Facebook Live platform. They’ll include unique camera angles optimized for mobile viewing, and may include ad tests, like putting ad breaks in the middle of streams, says The WSJ. According to Univision, more than 18 million English-language viewers have tuned in to its networks to watch soccer. The company sees this deal as being another way to reach those fans, and growing interest in the sport. “We are committed to serving our passionate fans,” said Gary Stevenson, president and managing director, MLS Business Ventures, in a statement. “We are working with all of our partners on making sure our games, and additional content, get to our fans anytime, anywhere, and on any device.” The deal is notable for Facebook, which has been interested for some time in bringing live sports content to its network. The company in the past streamed several USA Basketball Men’s and Women’s National Team exhibition games on Facebook Live, as well as other soccer matches, including an Orlando Pride match, Manchester United-Everton and a Spanish Women’s First Division match, last year. It also launched a Sports Hub on its network, to keep fans engaged with their favorite teams. As The WSJ reported in 2016, Facebook was then set to pay sports teams and athletes more than $4 million to use Facebook Live video. More recently, Facebook has been in talks with MLB to stream its content, Reuters reported this February. Deal terms for the MLS games have not been reported. Sports deals are often tough because many of the leagues are locked into contracts with broadcasters that limit to what extent they can make their content available to newer platforms like Facebook Live. But clearly, many are interested in dabbling in this space. Twitter, for example, has been beefing up its live content in recent months, and has in the past made deals with Wimbledon, MLB, the NHL, the NBA and the NFL for its Thursday night games.  \n",

            "Triplebyte wants to make recruiting and technical screening for tech companies more efficient. The screening process happens background-blind, so instead of putting the emphasis on the applicants’ resumes (and the colleges they went to), it emphasizes programming smarts. Triplebyte previously  only worked with Y Combinator-incubated companies, though. Now, however, it has expanded its program and is working with Facebook, Apple and other large companies. As Harj Taggar, the company’s CEO and co-founder (and former YC partner), tells me, the idea to start with YC companies was born out of the realization that the YC ecosystem was now big enough to provide the scale necessary for a service like this. As the company grew, though, the team realized that engineers wanted a broad choice of companies to work with (it only shows engineers companies that look like they would be a good match for their technical abilities). Besides Apple and Facebook, Triplebyte is now working with Asana, Palantir and others. The company’s promise to engineers is that they will be able to bypass the usual phone screening process and move right to onsite interviews if a company wants to work with them. For companies, Triplebyte promises that it has thoroughly screened the applicants through its online coding test and that they are a good fit for them. One interesting aspect of Triplebyte’s process is that when the company sends its candidates’ profile to a potential employer, it strips out the name, schools they attended and the companies where they’ve worked. “We do this to reduce bias in the screening process — recruiters are so used to screening based on keywords in resumes that this approach is what’s needed to increase the diversity of backgrounds in tech,” Taggar told me. Taggar says that the companies that use Triplebyte’s service typically make an offer to half the engineers his company sends them. That’s a 2x improvement over the industry standard, which is closer to 1 in 4. Given that this process upsets the traditional recruiting process, the company has faced some resistance from companies, Taggar admitted. “It’s scary for companies to commit to bringing candidates straight to an onsite without doing technical screening because each onsite is 4-5 hours of engineering time spent,” he told me. “The YC ecosystem was just more willing to trust us at first, which let us build up a data set to prove this process works and get to a scale where Facebook/Apple, etc. were willing to take a shot.”    \n",

            "342 Facebook Messenger Day launches as a Snapchat Stories clone for making plans\n",
            "Today Facebook  is globally launching Messenger Day to put a utilitarian spin on the slideshow format. While Snapchat Stories is for retelling what you’ve done, Messenger Day’s “Who’s up for?” filters and Active Now indicators help you find friends to chat and meet up with. Now after gaining millions of users through tests in a dozen countries like Poland and Australia, Messenger Day is rolling out for everyone at the top of Facebook’s chat app with today’s iOS and Android updates, plus in desktop messaging threads. The feature lets you share with the public or a custom friend decorated photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. If Messenger Day catches on, it could encourage visual communication through Messenger’s newly enhanced camera, jumpstart chat threads and get friends together offline. And Facebook’s VP of messaging David Marcus tells me Day will “probably” insert advertisements between posts to become one of Messenger’s first revenue streams. Alongside WhatsApp Status, Instagram Stories and Facebook Stories, Messenger Day could use convenience to compete with Snapchat for user growth, which has become a key weakness for Snap as it goes public. A billion people already use Messenger, after all. Snap’s share price dipped slightly this morning as Messenger Day was announced. The launch demonstrates Facebook’s philosophy that while Snapchat may have invented Stories, it’s actually a fundamental content medium bigger than any one company. Facebook is not afraid to copy, no matter what critics say. All that matters is whether it’s valuable to users. People will naturally ask why they need another place to share, and maybe they don’t. But if Messenger can reimagine the Stories format around usefulness instead of just fun, without inconveniencing the rest of the chat app, it could spur us to make more memories instead of just consuming old ones. “This is about today. It’s not about yesterday. It’s not about tomorrow,” Marcus tells me. “The two key functionalities are 1) I’m going to set context because it’s going to make for better conversations if people know where I am and what I’m doing. And 2) It’s about where I want to take my day, like ‘I’m bored and I want to go out for coffee’ or ‘I want to go see a movie’ so I’m going to use a frame, take a photo, and see which of my friends are going to engage with me to actually make that plan, because planning is one of the core capabilities of a messaging app.”  I got to spend yesterday trying Messenger Day on my own, and was impressed by how it accomplished both those objectives without adding friction to the app. Messenger Day appears above your chat threads on Messenger’s home screen, employing the same bold design that helped Instagram Stories rocket to 150 million daily users in 5 months. There you’ll see thumbnail tiles previewing the Days of friends, instead of just a name and profile pic. They’re reverse chronologically ordered to help you make plans with people sharing now. You can tap to fast-forward or rewind, and hold to pause, with your next friend’s Day appearing right after the last. That auto-advance style will make it easy to insert ads between Days.  While there’s no Like counter, Messenger lets you instantly reply privately to a Day with custom or pre-filled messages like “haha”, “Wow”, a heart, or a “100” emoji that show in your chat thread with that person. This drops the barrier for turning a broadcast into a conversation that can feel a bit daunting in Snapchat. And if you’re already chatting with someone who’s posted, you’ll see a call out on mobile and Facebook’s desktop site to watch their Day. One special feature that Snapchat doesn’t have: Active Now. You’ll see a green dot on the Messenger Days of friends who are currently available to chat with on the app. That breaks the ice to push users from seeing a friend doing something fun to asking if they can come join. In this way, Messenger might be a way to cure the loneliness that could succeed where Down To Lunch, Free and Foursquare failed.  Messenger’s big camera redesign from December seems tailor-made to boost Day usage. You can post by tapping the big shutter button at the bottom, the “Add To Your Day” spot at the top or from a prompt when you share imagery in a thread. Sharing options include natively shot photos and 15-second videos, as well as uploaded media, including GIFs that are shown inset with a black border to denote they’re old. You manually can save what you share frame by frame. By default, posts are visible to “Everyone except” specific people you block. However, Facebook says that only people who have permission to message you like Facebook friends will see your Days at the top of their app. You also can choose a specific list of people who can watch your Days, and this applies to everything you post, rather than having to be set each time. You’ll also have the option to send posts to friends directly as well as sharing to your Day. You’ll see the faces of people who’ve seen your Day at the bottom of the posts. Before or after you share, you can embellish your content with drawing, text captions, animated selfie lenses, environmental effects like overlaid bubbles or lava lamp colors, style-transfers that make your image look like a painting or sketch, virtual “Dress Up” props, speech bubbles, stickers and more than 5,000 illustrated filters. This is where Messenger Day’s unique slant on Stories for messaging comes in. The searchable, categorized filters include calls to action like “Who’s up for grabbing coffee?”, “Road trip”, “Movie night?”, “Let’s grab drinks”, “Let’s go for a run” and tons more. These make it easy and fun to invite friends to hang out with you offline. And unlike posting “who wants to grab dinner?” on Facebook, where a lack of responses could make you look unpopular, the posts disappear and all replies in Messenger Day are private so you don’t have to worry about seeming lonely. And in case there’s not the right filter for you, Messenger Day can take any text you write and turn it into a filter, like with your friend’s name or the place you’re located. These computer-generated filters make the creative options in Messenger Day ostensibly infinite. Overall, Messenger Day felt less interruptive and more seamless than I expected. Like Instagram Stories, it’s easy to ignore if you don’t care about it. And Messenger works fine even if friends only post to Day rarely, as that could reduce the noise and keep it focused on planning hangouts. Still, there’s plenty of missing features I immediately wish it had, including: The biggest priorities should be some basic color and light adjustment filters, and caption background colors because Messenger’s font is already a bit hard to read and can blend into the imagery to become unreadable. Surely with time, Messenger will adopt some of these and build more features that make it stand out. But for v1 of a global rollout, it does a remarkable job of hitting most of the key features so it immediately feels usable. For now businesses aren’t allowed on Day. There also are no ads, but when asked if he saw an opportunity for them, Marcus told me “Probably . . . we want to experiment with more ways to open threads with businesses . . . You never want us to get in the way of someone sending a message really quickly . . . as long as we keep that alive, we have license to experiment and see whether really good advertising that opens threads people want to have . . . is actually valuable.” Messenger Day’s “Who’s Up For?” filters help you plan to meet up with friends Visual communication is the future, and as I wrote yesterday in my deep dive about Messenger’s evolution, any chat app that doesn’t get on board is doomed. Still, Messenger is taking a risk here by putting Day above your threads, reducing the number you see on your screen at first. Branching out so aggressively into social media isn’t worth hampering Messenger’s growth in traditional chat, so Facebook will have to watch carefully to make sure different demographics around the world don’t message less after the rollout. Facebook was late to the Stories format, but now it’s approaching it and competing with Snapchat through every one of its core apps. If it succeeds, it could further curtail Snapchat’s growth, especially abroad in some markets where teens haven’t even tried it but have been on Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram for years. Facebook’s versions likely won’t eradicate Snapchatting by existing loyal users, but could chip away at its use cases while being good enough to convince some people they don’t need to sign up for another social network. There are no punches pulled here. Facebook is unabashedly stealing the best parts of Snapchat and putting them front and center. That might seem like the opposite of innovation, or at least bad sportsmanship. But Facebook’s ideology has always centered around scale, not originality. It wasn’t the first social network, but it’s the one that got everyone. It didn’t invent Stories, but time won’t necessarily reward the one that did. Just those that put them in everyone’s pockets.  \n",

            "343 Facebook debuts its first dedicated virtual reality app, Facebook 360\n",
            "Facebook  has devoted major resources and billions of dollars to virtual reality, but there has been a pretty clear line between what happens in the main Facebook app and what happens on the Oculus Rift and Gear VR.  Today, Facebook is intertwining the real and virtual worlds of Facebook a bit by launching its first dedicated app, Facebook 360. The app will serve as a hub for the 360 video and photo content posted to the site. Facebook boasts that there have ben more than one million 360 videos posted to the site alongside more than 25 million 360 photos to date. At launch, the Facebook 360 app will be available only for the Gear VR mobile headset. Users can download the app in the Oculus Store. At launch, Facebook 360 will feature four main “feeds,” delivering content into users’ eyeballs from closer than ever. The “Explore” tab will give users a bird’s-eye look at the 360 content that is popular across Facebook from a variety of media companies and creators; meanwhile, the “Following” tab will let you dial into the content being produced by your friends. “Saved” gives you an opportunity to experience 360 content you may have seen on the web in a more immersive in-headset experience, while “Timeline” lets you check out your own 360 photos and videos all in one place.  The app will allow users to post reactions to content, while also being able to save and share 360 photos and videos. Facebook said in a blog post that more social features are on the way for the company’s first official app. The wall of separation between Facebook and Oculus is a pretty murky one. With this latest addition, Facebook is asserting its video strength over the Oculus Video app, which has previously been the go-to spot for Gear VR users to engage with videos from Facebook. In January, Facebook named Xiaomi’s Hugo Barra as its VP of VR. The appointment was a surprising end to a leadership shakeup at Oculus that began when CEO Brendan Iribe announced suddenly that he would be stepping down as the company’s chief executive and would be leading Oculus’s PC VR division instead. While Facebook continues to work on its own suite of social VR features, it’s clear that the company has a grand vision in mind for bringing its nearly 2 billion users into the world of VR, and this app may be one of their earliest steps in doing so.  \n",

            "344 Facebook is making its cross-device Atlas data available to more advertisers\n",
            "Facebook  is changing the way it offers the cross-device ad measurement capabilities of its Atlas platform. The company relaunched the current version of Atlas in 2014 with a focus on what it calls “people-based marketing” — namely, the ability for advertisers to track users across devices. Last year, it shut down the ad serving part of the Atlas business and merged the remaining team into a central measurement group. Now, Product Marketing Director for Measurement Scott Shapiro said Facebook is moving into “the next phase of our measurement journey.” That means launching a new area of the Facebook Business Manager called Advanced Measurement, where it will be making Atlas  capabilities available in a self-serve way. “Previously, these tools were only available in Atlas for the largest enterprise marketers,” Shapiro said. “We’re expanding the access of functionality that only existed in Atlas to tens of thousands of marketers who use Facebook’s ad tools.” While Facebook says it’s too early to release screenshots of the Advanced Measurement dashboards, the company did give me a demo of the first two products, which are focused on reach and attribution — in other words, helping advertisers get an accurate count of how many people they’re reaching with their campaigns, and understanding which ads are actually leading to sales and other business outcomes.  To be clear, you’ll still need some degree of digital advertising expertise to use these tools. As Shapiro put it, “It’s businesses that have a real digital marketing person on staff. It’s not a coffee shop where the barista is posting once a day.” Facebook’s ad measurement has been under the spotlight recently due to multiple admissions that it was misreporting metrics, leading to calls for more third-party verification. However, Shapiro noted that the company continues to add independent advertising partners. Facebook says Advanced Measurement is currently in testing, with plans to refine the interface and introduce more data as it rolls out. The company also intends to move Atlas advertisers to the new interface over the next year.  \n",

            "345 Facebook’s content moderation system under fire again for child safety failures\n",
            "Facebook  has again been criticized for failing to remove child exploitation imagery from its platform following a BBC investigation into its system for reporting inappropriate content. Last year the news organization reported that closed Facebook groups were being used by pedophiles to share images of child exploitation. At the time Facebook’s head of public policy told it he was committed to removing “content that shouldn’t be there”, and Facebook has since told the BBC it has improved its reporting system. However, in a follow-up article published today, the BBC again reports finding sexualized images of children being shared on Facebook — the vast majority of which the social networking giant failed to remove after the BBC initially reported them. The BBC said it used the Facebook report button to alert the company to 100 images that appeared to break its guidelines against obscene and/or sexually suggestive content — including from pages that it said were explicitly for men with a sexual interest in children. Of the 100 reported images only 18 were removed by Facebook, according to the BBC. It also found five convicted pedophiles with profiles and reported them to Facebook via its own system but says none of the accounts were taken down — despite Facebook’s own rules forbidding convicted sex offenders from having accounts. In response to the report, the chairman of the UK House of Commons’ media committee, Damian Collins, told the BBC he has “grave doubts” about the effectiveness of Facebook’s content moderation systems. “I think it raises the question of how can users make effective complaints to Facebook about content that is disturbing, shouldn’t be on the site, and have confidence that that will be acted upon,” he said. In a further twist, the news organization was subsequently reported to the police by Facebook after sharing some of the reported images directly with Facebook when it asked to send examples of reported content that had not been removed. TechCrunch understands Facebook was following CEOP guidelines at this point — although the BBC claims it only sent images after being asked by Facebook to share examples of reported content. However viewing or sharing child exploitation images is illegal in the UK. The BBC would have to have sent Facebook links to illegal content, rather than shared images directly to avoid being reported — so it’s possible this aspect of the story boils down to a miscommunication. Facebook declined to answer our questions — and declined to be interviewed on a flagship BBC news program about its content moderation problems — but in an emailed statement UK policy director, Simon Milner, said: “We have carefully reviewed the content referred to us and have now removed all items that were illegal or against our standards. This content is no longer on our platform. We take this matter extremely seriously and we continue to improve our reporting and take-down measures. Facebook has been recognized as one of the best platforms on the internet for child safety.” “It is against the law for anyone to distribute images of child exploitation. When the BBC sent us such images we followed our industry’s standard practice and reported them to CEOP. We also reported the child exploitation images that had been shared on our own platform. This matter is now in the hands of the authorities,” he added. The wider issue here is that Facebook’s content moderation system remains very clearly very far from perfect. And contextual content moderation is evidently a vast problem that requires far more resources that are being devoted to it by Facebook. Even if the company employs “thousands” of human moderators, distributed in offices around the world (such as Dublin for European content) to ensure 24/7 availability, it’s still a drop in the ocean for a platform with more than a billion active users sharing multiple types of content on an ongoing basis. Technology solutions can be part of the solution — such as Microsoft’s PhotoDNA cloud service, which can identify known child abuse images, for example — but such systems can’t help identify unknown obscene material. It’s a problem that necessitates human-moderation and enough human moderators to review user reports in a timely fashion so that problem content can be identified accurately and removed promptly — in other words, the opposite of what appears to have happened in this instance. Facebook’s leadership cannot be accused of being blind to concerns about its content moderation failures. Indeed, CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently discussed the issue in an open letter — conceding the company needs to “do more”. He also talked about his hope that technology will be able to take a bigger role in fixing the problem in future, arguing that “artificial intelligence can help provide a better approach”, and saying Facebook is working on AI-powered content flagging systems to scale to the ever-growing challenge — although he also cautioned these will take “many years to fully develop”. And that’s really the problem in a nutshell. Facebook is not putting in the resources needed to fix the current problem it has with moderation — even as it directs resources into trying to come up with possible future solutions where AI-moderation can be deployed at scale. But if Zuckerberg wants to do more right now, the simple fix is to employ more humans to review and act on reports.  \n",

            "346 Facebook tests reactions and Dislike button (!) on messages\n",
            "Facebook  finally has a Dislike button, but it’s not where you’d expect. How do you reply to a specific message in a rapid-fire chat thread? Facebook wants you to attach emojis to your friends’ messages the same way you do with News Feed posts.   Hover over a message and tap the emoji button to add a Reaction   Reaction counter TechCrunch reader Hoan Do sent us a tip that Facebook Messenger is showing some users a Reactions option. When you hover over messages friends have sent in a chat thread, you can tap the emoji button to pick from attaching a little thumbs-up Like, thumbs-down Dislike, or a heart-eyes, lol, wow, sad, or angry emoji. Everyone in the thread will then see that Reaction counted below the specific message you attached it to, and you can tap to see a full list of who left which Reaction. Facebook confirmed this new feature to TechCrunch, saying “We’re always testing ways to make Messenger more fun and engaging. This is a small test where we enable people to share an emoji that best represents their feelings on a message.” That means not everyone has access now, but if people enjoy it, Messenger Reactions could roll out to all users. Notably, the Messenger reaction list differs from the News Feed one because of the addition of much-requested and always-denied Dislike button. Though it’s known as Facebook’s most asked for feature, the company didn’t want to inject too much negativity into the feed so it never built one. Instead, it built Reactions so people could share more nuanced emotions quickly, but left disliking for the comments. Facebook sees it as more a “no” button, the company tells me. It says people often use Messenger for planning and coordination, and it’s experimenting to see if a reactions are helpful for quick logistics and voting. Thats why it’s offering a Yes/No option, even though people will naturally see it as a Dislike button too.  Messenger Reactions are similar to iMessage’s recently-added Tapback emoji, a format pioneered in the west by Slack’s  Emoji Reactions. There they’ve proven especially useful in fast-flying group chats, where more messages may have come in before you can respond to one you’re interested in. Imagine this thread: Boss – Everyone OK with ordering pizza for lunch? Coworker 1 – Does anyone want to go to the food trucks instead? Coworker 2 – I’m going to go for sushi if anyone would rather do that. You – Yes. — Slack offers a similar Emoji Reactions menu and emoji counter on messages It’s totally ambiguous which message you’re responding to, and it’s annoying to have to say “Yes I want to go to the food trucks instead”. Before Slack finally added threaded conversations, it addressed this problem with Emoji Reactions. A lightweight social chat app like Messenger might not need threaded conversations, though it’s certainly a possibility, but porting over the News Feed Reactions makes perfect sense. Facebook launched Reactions almost exactly a year ago, and they proven popular, with over 300 billion sent so far. “Love” is the most frequently used, making up more than half of all Reactions. Mexico, Chile, and Suriname see the most Reactions per user. And now, Facebook is weighting Reactions a little more heavily than standard Likes when it’s determining how interesting a post is and how prominently to show it in the News Feed. Given the success of Emoji Reactions in Slack, the feature could make a strong addition to Work Chat, Facebook’s messaging system for its enterprise collaboration suite Workplace. It could also prove useful for interacting with chatbots, which Facebook also enhanced this week with persistent menus for when you don’t know what command to type. The more convenient Facebook can make Messenger, the better it can compete with Snapchat, Line, and Google’s fragmented mess of messaging apps. Offering the easiest way to reply could keep users locked into the Facebook ecosystem, even if their social media sharing strays to other apps.   \n",

            "347 Facebook adds a travel-planning feature called ‘City Guides’\n",
            "Facebook  has been busy with the app updates, as of late. In recent months, it has added new sections for finding nearby Wi-Fi, meeting new people, checking the weather, and more. Now, it’s rolling out yet another addition to the “More” menu inside the Facebook app: City Guides. A potential challenger to Foursquare, Facebook’s guides will show you a list of cities and which of your friends visited, along with various recommendations of places to go and things to do. When you click into an individual city, you’ll see a row of rounded profile icons of your friends who have visited there. Tap on each one, and a list of the places they’ve been – like hotels, restaurants, attractions, and other businesses – will appear. This data is presumably being extracted from users’ check-ins and Facebook posts.  Facebook has long allowed users to check-in via their status updates, but it hadn’t done much with that data, in terms of offering a consumer-facing feature to rival Foursquare. That’s been fairly surprising, given that asking friends for ideas of what to do in a new city seems like a perfect feature for a social network like Facebook. City Guides seems to correct that problem, or at least it’s trying to. The feature itself, however, is more useful if you have a lot of well-traveled friends. But also included in each city’s guide is a list of “Places the Locals Go,” which pulls in popular, highly rated spots. Here, Facebook uses technology to summarize what people are saying about the suggested place. For example, a restaurant’s summary might read: “People talk about delicious tacos, friendly atmosphere, and brews on tap.”   Each item has a bookmark icon to the right, which lets you save the place to a list of favorites. These bookmarked items are available in a “Saved” section at the top of the city’s page. You can also save the city itself, to make a sort of bucket list of places you want to go. Meanwhile, if you scroll down further in the guide, you’ll see a list of Upcoming Events, which you can swipe through horizontally. Beneath this, is a list of Popular Attractions, which includes things like famous landmarks, tourist attractions, and scenic places. All these can be bookmarked, as well.  Social travel planning apps (often using Facebook data) was an area where a number of startups competed years ago, including Gtrot, Zetrip, Roam7, Trippy, Jetpac, Gogobot and others. But the market later fizzled out. Belatedly, Facebook has stepped in. Its city guides feature feels like a socially infused version of a traditional travel planning app, but they’re also augmented with the public data available on Facebook, which makes them more useful. Unfortunately, City Guides seems to only focus on major international cities, and not the small, out-of-way locales that are also popular destinations, like beachy islands, quaint resort towns, remote small towns, and more. It would be great to see this city guides feature expanded in the future so you could pull up any city in the world, no matter its size, and see what your friends did while there. The City Guides feature was seen in testing last year, noted 9to5Mac, which also spotted this launch, but it now appears to be rolling out more broadly on mobile. Facebook confirmed the new feature, but noted it’s still in limited availability. “We’re testing a redesigned surface on city Pages that showcases information about your city, a spokesperson said. “This content already exists on Facebook, and during this test we’ll be centralizing it in a way that is more personalized and relevant to you. So, this new feature can help people get a better sense of their city, or a city they’re visiting through their friends’ eyes.”  \n",

            "348 As Messenger’s bots lose steam, Facebook pushes menus over chat\n",
            "Facebook’s Messenger  bots may not be having the impact the social network desired. Just yesterday, online retailer Everlane, one of the launch partners for the bot platform, announced it was ditching Messenger for customer notifications and returning to email. Following this, Facebook today announced an upgraded Messenger Platform, which introduces a new way for users to interact with bots: via simple persistent menus, including those without the option to chat with the bot at all. One of the problems with Facebook’s bots is that it’s often unclear how to get started. The directory of bots in Messenger wasn’t initially available and now only reveals itself when you start a search in the app. And it hasn’t always been obvious how to get a bot talking, once added, or how to navigate back and forth through a bot’s many sections. The Messenger platform update today tackles this latter problem, by offering an alternative to the more limited – and sometimes confusing – systems that were previously available. Instead of forcing users to talk with a bot, developers can choose to create a persistent menu that allows for multiple, nested items as a better way of displaying all the bots’ capabilities in a simple interface.  The new persistent menus are limited to three items at the top-level, and its sub-menus are now limited to five. Before, if users wanted to engage with a menu like this, they often had to engage in conversations with the bot to discover the various sections and items. Now, Facebook suggests to developers that they “consider stripping such exchanges down and cutting to the chase by putting the most important features in your menu.” For example, a retailer’s bot might offer menu options that let you “go shopping,” “ask questions,” or “send messages.” If you clicked into the shopping section, the menu could update with a list of items to drill down into, like tops, bottoms, shoes and accessories. Along with webviews – like, the product page for the shirt you want to buy, for example – the new experience feels more like navigating a mobile website within Messenger, instead of using a bot.  Also new is that developers can now choose to hide the composer screen, and forgo allowing customers to have a conversational experience in the bot entirely. I guess we can’t call them chatbots anymore? The question this leads to, of course, is whether or not any of this is necessary. If Facebook’s bots become more like mobile sites, what’s the point of using them in Messenger at all?  It feels like Facebook is going the wrong direction here. Messenger seems poised to be the company’s breakout platform for voice-based computing and voice-powered virtual assistants, but the company hasn’t put much focus on those emerging technologies. While it acquired voice and natural language startup Wit.ai in 2015, it hasn’t done much publicly with voice computing, beyond testing having Facebook turn voice clips into text during chat sessions. Today, you can’t connect the dots between Messenger and its many bots just by speaking. That is, it seems like you should be able to say to Messenger, “what’s the latest from CNN?” or “will it rain today?,” then have the appropriate bot respond. But this is not the case. Meanwhile, Facebook also toyed around with “M,” a virtual assistant inside Messenger, but this has yet to launch to more than a handful of testers. None of today’s other Messenger platform updates focus on these technologies, either. Instead, the larger update to version 1.4 includes things like expanded sharing capabilities that could help bots gain more exposure; tools to better match businesses’ customer lists to Messenger’s user base; a handful of new APIs; improved analytics; and other tweaks and features catering to specific developers’ needs. Facebook, meanwhile, is quickly becoming one of the largest tech companies without a clear path to the voice computing-powered future, where others like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung are today intensely competing. But with over a billion active Messenger users, Facebook has the luxury of taking the time to figure things out.  \n",

            "349 Blackstorm Labs looks to bring the co-op experience to a Facebook Messenger game\n",
            "Co-founder Ernestine Fu hopes that Blackstorm Labs,  the makers of a bullet hell-ish fantasy shooter called EverWing, has figured out how to tap into that real-time co-operative experience that you might find in a massive online game like World of Warcraft within Facebook Messenger. The company is calling the experience Boss Raids. EverWing runs on HTML5 within Facebook Messenger, where players take control of a fairy and then fly through levels taking down various monsters. With Boss Raids, multiple players face off against the same boss that has one giant pool of health. Each player, as they go through the level, ticks off a small amount of health for that boss. At the end, if all the players in the group have successfully done enough damage independently, the boss goes down and everyone shares the rewards from that boss. With mobile games traditionally linked to players going head-to-head with things like leaderboards and high scores, Blackstorm Labs’ attempt here is to craft a more co-operative experience to tap into a different kind of player behavior. You might have heard the phrase PvE (player-versus-environment) thrown around in gaming before, but it’s a sort of mirror to players competing against each other and has become a staple in online games. The levels reset once a week, meaning players have plenty of time to work to take down the boss together. “Humans naturally like helping friends and overcoming challenges, instead of competing with high scores,” Fu said. “It’s broadening the appeal and making it more than just a competition. We’re allowing people to help each other, and from a virality standpoint, groups want to recruit more and more friends to get through these boss raids.” The company hopes it’s tapping into a more unique take for co-operative gameplay that, while still asynchronous like other mobile games, brings the players closer together to the point that it starts to emulate real-time gameplay. The example would be people sitting around at a table, all trying to play a game at the same time, Fu said. With Facebook Messenger and instant games, people are able to jump into their sessions all at once, and all work toward the same end point. By doing that, and if people add more and more people to their groups to take down harder bosses, Blackstorm Labs also gets an extra jolt of virality for its game. These games from Blackstorm Labs are partly a showcase of technology that the company thinks can be broadened to any kind of application. With the App Store becoming cluttered, it’s hard for developers to get their apps in front of new users. There’s a lot of friction between getting new users to notice the app and actually download it, so the hope is that by removing that friction Blackstorm Labs can attract a wide array of developers and rethink the way apps are distributed and run. The company most-recently raised $33.5 million. Lead engineer Joseph Brown said that for many games, groups of people already naturally gather into guilds and teams for raids on other platforms like Facebook. You’ll see this happen all the time in online games that don’t have some kind of internal match-making system — like World of Warcraft in its early days, or games today like Destiny that have independent sites for forming groups. So it’s a user behavior that exists naturally, and this gameplay is just tapping into that. “The boss raids are meant to kind of capture that in a meaningful way and start exposing even more of that kind of fun, or MMO style gameplay, in this very casual Messenger experience,” Brown said. Being on Messenger, and by building HTML5 games, offers Blackstorm Labs an opportunity to rapidly experiment and release updates much more quickly than they might through the traditional App Store. Instead of having to download or update an app, simply refreshing the game would bring it open with little tweaks, and that also allows the team to quickly adjust to a fast-growing audience. “It’s been a learning process for us so far for sure, on how to build a system that can go from no users with very little warm-up time to suddenly hundreds of requests per second,” Brown said. “This stuff we’re talking about — how do we handle these kinds of boss raids — I think it’d be a disservice to not also mention the ease of development of the platform. We’ve been able to do some really interesting things, and do them really quickly. I would say that’s pretty fast considering we’re also going through it with a pretty large growth phase with users, which would normally cause a few server meltdowns probably.”  \n",

            " The last social network to truly “get” music was MySpace — unfortunately, they didn’t get much else. Today’s biggest player, Facebook, doesn’t “get” music — and artists still don’t really use it. Even though they have the biggest audience and market cap in the space, they are a Menlo Park, Calif.-based company with a Silicon Valley culture. No disrespect at all, but through my time in the valley, for all the positives and successes it has, understanding the science of cool and culture isn’t one of them. YouTube didn’t take advantage of its early lead focus on music quickly enough and has lost some of its luster — I  actually wrote an article years ago on why YouTube was the biggest music platform in the world before Spotify came to the U.S. Twitter shuttered its own Twitter #Music platform because of low engagement and hasn’t been able to figure it out yet. But Snap might be the one that finally cracks the code. When you look at MySpace, music was the primary reason it blew up. Other social networks at the time, such as Friendster, didn’t focus on music, while MySpace catered to it — and everyone had music on their profile. Numerous artists broke solely because of the platform — I know firsthand. When MySpace was first getting traction and was in a small Santa Monica office, I met its co-founder and chief executive, Chris DeWolfe, and pitched him the concept of the MySpace DJ program. This campaign became a key driver for the platform and one of the big factors of MySpace’s growth. I used my relationships with DJs and artists to get them to not only become active on the site and use it as a way to communicate with the world, but to in turn promote the social network to their audience — creating a viral marketing loop at no cost. Basically, the biggest DJs and artists in the world would go on air and tell people to visit them on MySpace — talk about a growth hack!  Today, Snap is the new next great platform and has the opportunity to own music amongst its competitors. The first reason is culture and leadership. Evan Spiegel is well-known as a music lover and has good taste. He understands cool (just look at the rollout of Spectacles versus Google Glass) and understands the importance of music. Furthermore, with Snap being based in the music capital of the world today, Los Angeles, they are naturally exposed to a far superior music culture than Silicon Valley. So why hasn’t Snap pulled the trigger on music yet? This is the potential multi-billion-dollar question. I’d first blame the music industry. Record labels are notoriously slow on integrating new technology and are known to always try to stick up anyone for massive licensing fees in the short term without thinking about the opportunity in the long term. Not to justify their position, but they reacted too late to Napster and then let Apple monopolize the market with iTunes, so they are hesitant to grant any favors. Both sides are probably too scared of precedent and doing a deal that ultimately screws one over the other. Content owners think that tech companies don’t have respect for content and just use content to build their business without paying for it (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). And the tech companies feel the content companies are dinosaurs that don’t get it and that they should thank them for the promotion. In 2015, rumors swirled about Snapchat buying Taylor Swift’s label, Big Machine Records, and have since persisted amongst other parties in the music industry, but none have gone through. Taylor Swift removes all of her albums from Spotify because of the low royalties associated with streaming I believe that while Snap and Evan deeply want to do something with music, they didn’t find the right entry point. For one, after jumping in at the allure of the music business, they probably realized being a record label or management company isn’t a business they want to be in. Look under the hood and you’ll find the bodies, and realize that for every Taylor Swift you have to fund and develop hundreds of others who will go nowhere. Artist development isn’t that fun. Secondarily, I don’t believe dealing with the people in the music business was that appealing, as they try to reinvent the music the same way they reinvented the camera. Other companies who have tried to get into music fail or do not realize their full potential by hiring old-school music executives who typically have minimal experience in building products and who live on yesteryear’s accomplishments. More times than not, they don’t understand the new era and try to force the old-school music business mentality on companies, which never works in the long term — and Snap has stayed away from this trap thus far. Most importantly, I think Snap and Evan probably look at themselves as curators instead of just content creators — which is a far better space to be in — and want to showcase the best of the best without putting all their eggs in one basket. That is what the entire public Snap platform is about — they filter the live stories down to the best entries and use Discover partners to take out the noise in news — imagine them doing the same for music. Their Shazam integration is an OK utility, but unfortunately does not align with the core product in that it lacks any creation ability and misses engagement potential; i.e. Snaps cannot be Shazamed. Recently, we started being introduced to songs behind specific lenses. One artist publicly complained about getting paid, which again I believe comes down to Snap needing to form a better bridge to the music business and community. Snap needs to better state to the industry the value in putting a song behind a filter.  Not being a dick, but no one is going to Snapchat today to listen to random music they haven’t heard before, and many new faces discover it by hearing it there and interacting — something they charge brands a lot of money for. It’s a simple formula. Music wins with repetition. You have to hear a song over and over before it clicks. Ahem, thus why radio still works. Back to the subject, though — I think this is a cool way to introduce music and new songs — but still just an entry point that clearly needs some massaging to get right within the business. Ultimately, I think with Snap’s culture and vision, if they crack music, it can become one of the biggest features on the platform and a giant revenue stream. Too many of the music services are just utilities where you can get music. I don’t believe it will be in the form of an on-demand subscription service (too saturated, low margins, label drama with licensing), but something more along the lines of curation that you see already with Discovery video. Snapchat is all about making things easy and building products consumers love and can easily engage with. Free, thoughtless and curated. Because of their popularity today (and young audience), team/location/culture and almost most importantly the fact that no social network (still in existence) has figured out music, Snap has a window to take over the music space. It needs to move fast though, and take advantage of its momentum while thwarting others who want to jump in. Facebook may be planning to finally make a real jump into music this year (side note: Instagram has interesting potential, as well, with its massive growth and newfound product focus on copying elements that work on other platforms — ahem, Snap), YouTube is a sleeping giant that I think could be very close to turning the corner and Twitter could wake up and realize how to make audio a hook for its users. I’ve intentionally left out Apple, Pandora and Spotify because they are utilities, which I don’t think chase the same audience or space that Snap ultimately will (want to) go.  \n",

            "\n",
            " If Snap gets serious about music and builds the right team and product for the space, they have the opportunity to own music amongst its rivals. When you look at the product roadmap from Snap’s roadshow, you see they are targeting the media advertising business. Let’s not forget that more than $46 billion dollars a year is spent on radio advertising alone — something I’m sure they would love to get a piece of, and could easily disrupt as it transitions from analog to digital. Most importantly, they have the right culture and are at the right place at the right time in a market no one truly owns today. Music could be Snap’s next killer product and help them take over the world. What’s old is new again. Remember how I said Snap reintroduced cameras and changed the way they were used? They have the same chance now with audio — most specifically, evolving what radio is: The No. 1 curation platform and where 58 percent of all audio consumption today takes place. A platform that digitally has lower rates that are statutory and can go around record labels without licensing directly… and something ripe for disruption that can be used to filter out the noise and curate the best. Adding Snap radio to the discover section only makes sense, and would make Snapchat the biggest music platform in the world, and target an oft-ignored $46 billion global industry ripe for disruption.  \n",

            "If somehow you have really great Facebook friends who share interesting videos, the new Facebook Video app on the Apple  TV is for you and it’s available now. Facebook’s VP of Partnerships Dan Rose already announced that a Facebook app for your TV screen was on its way. But it looks like it’s coming sooner than expected. Facebook has been trying hard to convince people that the social network can also become one of the leading platforms for online videos. And if the company wants to fight against YouTube, having an app on your TV seems like an important step. The Apple TV app doesn’t let you browse your newsfeed or see your friends’ photos. It’s all about video playback and live streaming. You can see videos shared by your friends, go to a specific page and watch their videos (I’d recommend TechCrunch’s page, I’ve heard they do nice videos). Facebook also tries to recommend videos based on your interests. And the company knows a lot about you, so let’s see if these recommendations are any good. You can save videos on another device and watch them later on your TV. And then, there’s live video. Facebook recommends popular live streams so that you can tune in from your TV. More interestingly, according to Reuters, Facebook is thinking about signing a deal with the MLB to stream one baseball game per week. This could be a sign that Facebook wants to ramp up exclusive live content, starting with sports. The app is currently featured in the tvOS App Store. So you can head over there to install it on your Apple TV. Facebook Video also launched on Samsung TVs earlier this week. And I’m sure you can expect apps on other platforms soon.  \n",

            "352 Facebook brings suicide prevention tools to Live and Messenger\n",
            "In Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent manifesto, he wrote about how Facebook  is in a unique position to help prevent people from doing harm to themselves. Worldwide, there is a suicide attempt every 40 seconds, according to the World Health Organization. Among those aged 15-29 years old, suicide is the second leading cause of death. Today, Facebook is unveiling new tools to provide support to people who may be suicidal, as well as resources for friends of those who are feeling suicidal via Facebook Live and Messenger. These tools are in addition to the ones Facebook offers for people who see concerning posts and want to help their friends or family.  Let’s say you’re watching your friend stream something via Facebook Live and they say something that worries you. You’ll now be able to reach out to the person and report the video to Facebook, which will be able to provide a set of resources to the person while they’re streaming via Live. The resources include reaching out to a friend, contacting a helpline or seeing tips and suggestions about working through difficult times. “Some might say we should cut off the livestream, but what we’ve learned is cutting off the stream too early could remove the opportunity for that person to receive help,” Facebook Researcher Jennifer Guadagno told me. Facebook did not do this by themselves. It partnered with organizations like the Crisis Text Line, the National Eating Disorder Association and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Through those partnerships, those in crisis will be able to immediately and directly connect with mental health service providers through Facebook Messenger. “What we heard from various people is any extra friction in someone reaching out for support can be the thing that stops them from getting support,” Facebook Product Manager Vanessa Callison-Burch told TechCrunch. “We’re hopeful that having this as an additional way to connect to support reduces the friction.” Facebook is also utilizing artificial intelligence and pattern recognition based on previously reported posts to identify posts by people who may be suicidal. If the pattern recognition tool flags a post, Facebook’s community operations team will review it and provide resources if necessary. Facebook said it “might be possible in the future” to bring this sort of AI and pattern recognition to Facebook Live and Messenger, but the team said it’s too early to say for sure.  \n",

            "Facebook’s new video app is now available on Samsung Smart TVs – which makes Samsung the first platform to feature the social network’s latest application. Facebook had announced earlier this month that it was soon releasing a video app aimed at connected TVs and other media players, like Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV, but didn’t unveil a specific launch date for any of those platforms. According to Samsung, the Facebook video app for TV is now available on Samsung Smart TVs, including its 2017 QLED TV lineup and all of its 2015, 2016, 2017 Smart TV models. Samsung is the only TV manufacturer that’s supporting the Facebook app at launch, the company also notes. The app itself allows users to sign into their own Facebook accounts, then view the videos shared by friends or Pages they follow, as well as top videos and others recommended to them based on their interests. You only have to authenticate with Facebook one time – after installing the app and launching it for the first time, says Samsung. News of Facebook’s app for the TV’s big screen was originally detailed by Facebook’s VP of Partnerships Dan Rose at the CODE Media conference. The move represents Facebook’s attempt to better compete with video-sharing rival YouTube as a place where creators want to upload and share their work, as well as place where those videos can be more easily discoverable. The company also said at the time that videos in the News Feed would now play with the sound on, unless your device was set to silent. And the company said that it would no longer crop vertical video, to better compete with Snapchat. A picture-in-picture mode was introduced, as well, allowing you to watch a video by pulling it out to the side of your feed, as you continued to scroll. More recently, Facebook announced it would test ads in the middle of videos – something that could help publishers make more money from their Facebook videos. This is an area where Facebook is still challenged, as compared with YouTube. Combined, these changes are designed to make video a more central part of Facebook’s social network, which is often still used more for things like text updates, sharing links, and posting photos. But Facebook’s focus on video has been expanding, thanks to its launch of live streaming, and other advanced video tools. This includes those that allow creators more control over how their content is shared, such as Rights Manager, its version of YouTube’s Content ID, introduced at last year’s Facebook F8 conference. With an app for watching video on TVs, Facebook gains another means of capturing users’ attention, not to mention ad dollars. The company has not yet said when the video app will launch on Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV, but given Samsung’s news, that may not be far off. Facebook’s video app is available now via the Samsung Smart Hub  \n",

            "While Google is using MWC to show off some of its advances in native apps on mobile devices — specifically in chat apps — the world’s biggest chat app company is doing something completely different. Today, Facebook announced that it is building a 770-kilometer (500-mile) fiber backhaul network in Uganda, in partnership with India’s Airtel and wholesale provider BCS, carriers that both have networking businesses in the country; and its Telecom Infrastructure Project is leading a call to invest $170 million into telecoms infrastructure startups. Alongside this, the company is also making headway on its other efforts to play a bigger role in the infrastructure behind how people connect to the internet (and specifically to Facebook)  through its Telecom Infrastructure Project. Facebook’s own Voyager optical networking transponder is now being deployed and tested by the carriers Telia and Orange in Europe. Facebook said it expects the Uganda project — which will see “tens of millions of investment” from Facebook — to cover access for more than 3 million people (that’s not how many will use it, but how many can potentially be covered). As a backhaul network, the purpose will be to provide more capacity to wireless carriers’ base stations so that they can offer 3G and 4G mobile data services (in many places in the developing world, carriers still can offer no more than 2G or 2.5G). The Voyager project, meanwhile, is one of a number of updates from the TIP, which was created by Facebook last year but (like Facebook’s other connectivity project, Internet.org) counts a number of other members — in this case, over 450, including large and small, regional carriers; equipment and software vendors like Intel and Microsoft; and more. Other news from the TIP today included the announcement that TIP is expecting $170 million in investment into startups that are building or working on telecom infrastructure solutions. This, in my opinion, is an interesting development, considering how so much of the recent period of development in startups and their funding has been focused on software solutions. Facebook and the TIP are not revealing too many details yet on which companies would be the recipients of this funding — we have asked and will update as we learn more — but it notes that investors that are contributing to that $170 million total include Atlantic Bridge, Capital Enterprise, Downing Ventures, Entrepreneur First, Episode 1 Ventures, IP Group plc, Oxford Sciences Innovation and Touchstone Innovations, along with other investors, incubators and institutions.  “We believe this focused investment direction from these innovative investors will bring new infrastructure solutions to the industry,” Facebook said in today’s announcement. To be clear, this is not a fund; it’s more of a conceptual idea of how much these investors are willing to invest in startups in the area of communications infrastructure: they will have their own funds and commitments that will, in theory, get them to that total. During a meeting at MWC, Facebook VP Jay Parikh offered a for more details on how Facebook is involved. “Facebook is not actually investing in that in terms of actual money. That’s the VCs. We are lending our expertise in mentoring, we help them understand how to do hackathons, how to build out their space, we will offer any expertise we can if they decide to use our open source hardware and software.” He added that the company is essentially helping to bring the knowledge it gained from running its production environment at scale and its culture to these centers. “It’s more sustainable this way,” he noted. The academic groups in the TIP will meanwhile put their emphasis on investing in university spinouts or those using university IP for comms infrastructure solutions. Some of the technologies will include stuff like smart antennas and wireless energy transfer. To that end, there are also two new “acceleration centers” getting launched in the UK, spearheaded by BT, for carriers and Facebook to consider and deploy infrastructure solutions from startups in the field. This is on top of a first center that Facebook launched in South Korea last year with SK Telecom. You can read more about TIP’s other projects, which are largely in the very technical, piloting phase of networking technology, here.  Network connectivity, and Facebook’s “mission to connect the world,” have been longstanding side themes for the social networking company, whose bread and butter continues to be advertising on its social network, which includes Facebook, but also Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. Whereas Facebook usage is nearly ubiquitous in regions like North America and Western Europe, in developing markets, especially in places where the infrastructure is lacking for good internet access, it’s less used, and so Facebook’s connectivity efforts are in part a way of creating the right circumstances to attract more business. But those efforts, while having an overtly charitable and good goal of bridging the digital divide, have had very mixed results up to now. Internet.org — the project where Facebook has partnered with several other companies to provide essentially “free” mobile internet in selected countries — backfired when it got blocked in India over net neutrality concerns (specifically that Facebook’s initiative was helping Facebook more than anyone else). It’s still managed to connect 40 million people with the initiative, which has continued to expand. Parikh noted in today’s press conference that the company is currently focused on the Express Wifi project in India and that we should “stay tuned” for any further announcements. And a test of its Aquila drone, a “plane” that beams down Internet access, had a crash as a result of a structural failure. And while today’s news is about how Facebook appears to be focusing more on building the exact physical infrastructure that it has said in the past was too costly to deploy, it’s also continuing to explore further wireless options, such as this plan to offer access in Africa via satellite. That plan faced a setback when Facebook’s first satellite was destroyed when SpaceX’s rocket exploded last year. Parikh, however, believes that satellites are something the company remains to be interested in and that it is the best solution for remote areas (and potentially a complimentary technology to its Aquila drone efforts). The Internet.org situation in India shows how governments, businesses and the general public are indeed raising questions about what the full benefits or detriments are of companies like Facebook getting more involved in areas like connectivity. These are questions that will continue to be raised as Facebook provides ever-loftier presentations of its vision. Meanwhile, on a more basic level, there are ongoing questions of just how beneficial more connectivity is without better understanding of what’s being shared. The rise of fake news, for example, coupled with freshly minted surfers, is a scary prospect. Updated to clarify that the $170 million is a target amount, rather than a specific fund, and also to add in more detail about what kinds of areas might get startup investment.  \n",

            "Mark Zuckerberg  believes we should be “coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.” That’s why Facebook’s  latest feature feels a bit confusing. Facebook has added nearly 200 flags to its Profile Frames feature, which lets you overlay imagery filters atop your profile photo. Facebook first launched profile frames for sports teams in 2015, and started letting people submit their own frames last year.  But today’s push of flags, many for individual countries, seems to simultaneously align with Zuckerberg’s idea of finding your community on Facebook, yet contradicts the view of the world as a unified global community. If users are proudly waving their country’s flag all over Facebook, it might make them appear even more foreign to users from elsewhere. It’s this “us versus them” ideology that Zuckerberg rails against in his 5,000-word manifesto, but that is somewhat propelled by these profile flags. While this might be a minor launch meant to just be fun and patriotic, it outlines the potential concerns with Facebook’s leader taking an outright stand on world issues. Rather than simply maximizing for user engagement, shareholder value and its basic mission to connect people, it must also weigh whether product changes align with its new mission of a safe, inclusive, informed global community. We need world leaders, including tech CEOs, to stand up for justice and safety for everyone in these dire days of Trump. But that push for the greater good could complicate the facts of running their businesses.  \n",

            "356 Facebook tests ad breaks in all types of videos, giving creators a 55% cut\n",
            "Facebook  today announced it has begun testing ad breaks that interrupt on-demand video, using a small set of partners who will earn a 55 percent ad revenue share while Facebook keeps 45 percent. That could change the way creators make video content so they tease viewers enough to sit through the ads, while luring more producers to Facebook. On-demand video publishers will get to select where in their video they want to insert an ad break, but it must be at least 20 seconds in and at least 2 minutes apart. Recode reported last month that ad breaks were coming. Facebook’s Audience Network for showing ads in other apps now lets all publishers host in-stream video ads, after testing them this year. Here’s what two of Facebook’s video ad breaks look like, via Matt Navarra Facebook is also expanding its existing test of ad breaks in Live videos that it announced in August. Now Pages and profiles in the U.S. that have at least 2,000 followers and reached at least 300 concurrent viewers in one of their recent Live videos are eligible to insert ad breaks. After at least 4 minutes of broadcasting to at least 300 concurrent viewers, they’ll see a “You can take an ad break” money sign alert alongside real-time comments on their video. Tapping that initiates an ad break up to 20 seconds, and creators can take more ad breaks every 5 minutes. Now both live broadcasters and recorded content creators on Facebook will earn a share of ad revenue from their viewers, creating an open monetization platform that could persuade creators to choose Facebook Live. Ad breaks could actually make it easier for Live creators to be on camera, because if they need to take a quick breather, adjust their hair or switch settings, they can do it off camera. The ad breaks can include vertical video, a further sign of Facebook invading Snapchat’s domain. And Facebook’s plan takes all the work out of monetization, because its team handles all the ad sales and accounting. Outside of big news and entertainment publishers, many of the web’s top video creators are teens and young adults shooting from their bedrooms and desperate to turn their hobby into a profession. That’s why YouTube, which pays them, has been the clubhouse for these videographers. Now they have good reason to put their content on Facebook beyond the virality, even if it cannibalizes their YouTube view counts. And Facebook’s ad breaks might lure Live broadcasters away from competitor Periscope, which has only begun doing big sponsorship deals with celebrities. Facebook was already doing one-off deals with big publishers to get them using Live, but now Facebook’s incentive system is available to a much wider range of broadcasters. Previously, Facebook only showed video ads as either related videos after you watched one purposefully, or as distinct ad units in the feed. Now it can earn cash directly from the more than 100 million hours of video people watch on its platform, and that stat was from a year ago, before Facebook’s continued rise as a video host. Facebook video consumption could also rise beyond its home on mobile with the company’s launch of video viewing apps for TV set-top boxes, though for now it’s not showing ads there. The big concern here, though, is that video makers will purposefully delay the best parts of videos until after ad breaks, making them much less watchable. Currently, creators try to cram the flashiest moments of their content in the first few seconds to catch people’s eyes while they’re scrolling the feed, giving people what they want up front. Now creators might instead use the first 20 seconds of videos to build suspense to a cliffhanger, insert an ad break and then put the meat of the video after they’ve already earned their cut. Along with the switch from videos autplaying silently to having sound on by default, the whole Facebook video creation playbook will have to change. Facebook’s VP of partnerships Nick Grudin tells TechCrunch, “Whether on Facebook or off, we’re committed to continuing to work with our partners to develop new monetization products and ad formats for digital video. It’s early days, but today’s updates are a step towards this goal.” Together, these initiatives could let Facebook further boost the cash it earns from the same amount of News Feed space. If Facebook can lure the best content onto its platform, users will end up sitting through more lucrative ads than if they were just scrolling past photo ads in the feed.  \n",

            "Would you tell Facebook you’re happy to see all the bared flesh it can show you? And that the more gratuitous violence it pumps into your News Feed the better? Obtaining answers to where a person’s ‘line’ on viewing what can be controversial types of content lies is now on Facebook’s product roadmap — explicitly stated by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a lengthy blog post last week, not-so-humbly entitled ‘Building a global community‘. Make no mistake, this is a huge shift from the one-size fits all ‘community standards’ Facebook has peddled for years — crashing into controversies of its own when, for example, it disappeared an iconic Vietnam war photograph of a naked child fleeing a napalm attack. In last week’s wordy essay — in which Zuckerberg generally tries to promote the grandiose notion that Facebook’s future role is to be the glue holding the fabric of global society together, even as he fails to flag the obvious paradox: that technology which helps amplify misinformation and prejudice might not be so great for social cohesion after all — the Facebook CEO sketches out an impending change to community standards that will see the site actively ask users to set a ‘personal tolerance threshold’ for viewing various types of less-than-vanilla content. On this Zuckerberg writes: The idea is to give everyone in the community options for how they would like to set the content policy for themselves. Where is your line on nudity? On violence? On graphic content? On profanity? What you decide will be your personal settings. We will periodically ask you these questions to increase participation and so you don’t need to dig around to find them. For those who don’t make a decision, the default will be whatever the majority of people in your region selected, like a referendum. Of course you will always be free to update your personal settings anytime. With a broader range of controls, content will only be taken down if it is more objectionable than the most permissive options allow. Within that range, content should simply not be shown to anyone whose personal controls suggest they would not want to see it, or at least they should see a warning first. Although we will still block content based on standards and local laws, our hope is that this system of personal controls and democratic referenda should minimize restrictions on what we can share. A following paragraph caveats that Facebook’s in-house AI does not currently have the ability to automatically identify every type of (potentially) problematic content. Though the engineer in Zuck is apparently keeping the flame of possibility alive — by declining to state the obvious: that understanding the entire spectrum of possible human controversies would require a truly super-intelligent AI. (Meanwhile, Facebook’s in-house algorithms have shown themselves to be hopeless at being able to correctly ID some pretty bald-faced fakery. And he’s leaning on third party fact-checking organizations — who do employ actual humans to separate truth and lies — to help fight the spread of Fake News on the platform, so set your expectations accordingly… ) “It’s worth noting that major advances in AI are required to understand text, photos and videos to judge whether they contain hate speech, graphic violence, sexually explicit content, and more. At our current pace of research, we hope to begin handling some of these cases in 2017, but others will not be possible for many years,” is how Zuck frames Facebook’s challenge here. The problem is this — and indeed much else in the ~5,000-word post — is mostly misdirection. The issue is not whether Facebook will be able to do what he suggests is its ultimate AI-powered goal (i.e. scan all user-shared content for problems; categorize everything accurately across a range of measures; and then dish up exactly the stuff each user wants to see in order to keep them fully engaged on Facebook, and save Facebook from any more content removal controversies) — rather the point is Facebook is going to be asking users to explicitly give it even more personal data. Data that is necessarily highly sensitive in nature — being as the community governance issue he’s flagging here relates to controversial content. Nudity, violence, profanity, hate speech, and so on. Yet Facebook remains an advertising business. It profiles all its users, and even tracks non-users‘ web browsing habits, continually harvesting digital usage signals to feed its ad targeting algorithms. So the obvious question is whether or not any additional data Facebook gathers from users via a ‘content threshold setting’ will become another input for fleshing out its user profiles for helping it target ads. We asked Facebook whether it intends to use data provided by users responding to content settings-related questions in future for ad targeting purposes but the company declined to comment further on Zuckerberg’s post. You might also wonder whether, given the scale of Facebook’s tracking systems and machine learning algorithms, couldn’t it essentially infer individuals’ likely tolerance for controversial content? Why does it need to ask at all? And isn’t it also odd that Zuckerberg didn’t suggest an engineering solution for managing controversial content, given, for example, he’s been so intent on pursuing an engineering solution to the problem of Fake News. Why doesn’t he talk about how AI might also rise to the complex challenge of figuring out personal content tastes without offending people? “To some extent they probably can already make a very educated, very good guess at [the types of content people are okay seeing],” argues Eerke Boiten, senior lecturer in computer science at the University of Kent. “But… telling Facebook explicitly what your line in the sand is on different categories of content is in itself giving Facebook a whole lot of quite high level information that they can use for profiling again. “Not only could they derive that information from what they already have but it would also help them to fine-tune the information they already have. It works in two directions. It reinforces the profiling, and could be deduced from profiling in the first place.” “It’s checking their inferred data is accurate,” agrees Paul Bernal, law lecturer at the University of East Anglia. “It’s almost testing their algorithms. ‘We reckon this about you, this is what you say — and this is why we’ve got it wrong’. It can actually, effectively be improving their ability to determine information on people.” Bernal also makes the point that there could be a difference, in data protection law terms, if Facebook users are directly handing over personal information about content tolerances to Facebook (i.e. when it asks them to tell it) vs such personal information being inferred by Facebook’s indirect tracking of their usage of its platform. “In data protection terms there is at least some question if they derive information — for example sexuality from our shopping habits — whether that brings into play all of the sensitive personal data rules. If we’ve given it consensually then it’s clearer that they have permission. So again they may be trying to head off issues,” he suggests. “I do see this as being another data-grab, and I do see this as being another way of enriching the value of their own data and testing their algorithms.” “I’m not on Facebook and this makes it even clearer to me why I’m not on Facebook because it seems to me in particular this is increasing risks and increasing our vulnerability at a time when we should be doing exactly the opposite,” adds Bernal. Facebook users are able to request to see some of the personal data Facebook holds on them. But, as Boiten points out, this list is by no means complete. “What they give you back is not the full information they have on you,” he tells TechCrunch. “Because some of the tracking they are doing is really more sophisticated than that. I am absolutely, 100 per cent certain that they are hiding stuff in there. They don’t give you the full information even if you ask for it. “A very simple example of that is that they memorize your search history within Facebook. Even if you delete your Facebook search history it still autocompletes on the basis of your past searches. So I have no doubt whatsoever that Facebook knows more than they are letting on… There remains a complete lack of transparency.” So it at least seems fair that Facebook could take a shot at inferring users’ content thresholds, based on the mass of personal data it holds on individuals. (One anecdotal example: I recall once seeing a notification float into my News Feed that a Facebook friend had liked a page called “Rough sex”, which would seem to be just the sort of relevant preference signal Facebook could use to auto-determine the types of content thresholds Zuckerberg is talking about, at least for users who have shared enough such signals with it.) But of course if it did that Facebook would be diving headfirst into some very controversial territory. And underlining exactly how much it knows about you, dear user — and that might come across as especially creepy when paired with a News Feed that’s injecting graphic content into your eyeballs because it thinks that’s what you want to see. “Given the level at which they’re profiling we shouldn’t tell them anymore,” says Boiten, when asked whether people should feel okay feeding Facebook info about their ‘line in the sand’ — pointing to another controversy that arose last year when it emerged Facebook’s ad capabilities could be used to actively exclude or include people with specific ethnic affinities (aka ‘racial profiling’). “If they make the advances in understanding of natural language content — the AI slant that Zuckerberg’s [blog post] promises, probably unrealistically, but nevertheless — if they get that sort of advantage then blimey they’re going to know an awful lot more than they already do,” he adds. “You can bet that they’re going to be profiling people based on their standards settings in this way,” adds Bernal. “That’s how it works, and then they aggregate it and they’ll be using it — I bet — to target their advertising and so on. It is more total information management. The more they can get, and the more granular those personal controls get the more information they’re picking up. “And I do think it’s disingenuous in that Zuckerberg’s post is not mentioning any of this.” While it’s not yet clear exactly how (or when) these content settings will be implemented, the structure sketched out by Zuckerberg already looks pretty problematic — given that Facebook users who do not want to share any additional sensitive signals with the ad-targeting giant will be forced to tolerate their peers’ predilections. Which immediately puts pressure on users to confess their content likes/dislikes to Facebook in order to avoid this ‘hell is other people’s tastes’ bind — i.e. in order to not be subject to the preferences of a local median. And to avoid being tainted by association of the types of content showing up (or not showing up) in their News Feed. After all, the Facebook News Feed is inherently individual — so there’s a risk of the character of the content in a user’s Feed being assumed to be a reflection of their personal tastes. So by not telling Facebook anything about your content thresholds you’re put into a default corner of telling Facebook you’re okay with whatever the regional average is okay with, content wise. And that may be the opposite of okay for you. “I think there’s another little trap here that they’ve done before,” continues Bernal. “When you make controls granular it looks as if you’re giving people control — but actually people generally get bored and don’t bother changing anything. So you can say you’ve given people control, and now it’s all much better — but in general they don’t use it. The few people who do are the few people who would understand it and get round it anyway. It will be very interesting to see what extent people actually use it.” Such a majority rule system could also be at risk of being gamed by — let’s say — mischievous 4Channers banding together and working to get graphic boundaries opened up in a region where more conservative standards are the norm. “I can see people gaming this kind of system — in the way that all kinds of online polls and referenda are gamed, somebody will work out the way to get the systems set the way they want… There are all kinds of possibilities,” argues Bernal. “There’s also a danger of ‘community leaders’ taking some degree of control; recommending people particular settings. I’m wary of Zuckerberg ending up doing this so you have standards for particular kind of people, so you ‘chose’ the standards that someone else has effectively chosen for you.” A lot will depend on the implementation of the content controls, certainly, but when you look at how easily, for example, Facebook’s trending news section — not to mention its News Feed in general — has been shown to be vulnerable to manipulation (by purveyors of clickbait, Fake News etc) it suggests there could well be risks of content settings being turned on their head, and ending up causing more offenses than they were trying to prevent. Another point Bernal makes is that shifting some of the responsibility for the types of content being shown onto users implicitly shifts some of the blame away from Facebook when controversies inexorably arise. So, basically: see something you don’t like in your News Feed in future? Well, that’s YOUR fault now! Either you didn’t set your Facebook content settings correctly. Or you didn’t set any at all… Tsk! In other words, Facebook gets to deflect objections to the type of content its algorithms are shunting into the News Feeds of users all over the world as a ‘settings configuration’ issue — sidestepping having to address the more systemic and fundamental flaw embedded into the design of the Facebook product: aka the filter bubble issue. Facebook has long been accused of encouraging a narrowing of personal perspective via its user-engagement focused content hierarchies. And Zuckerberg’s blog post has a fair amount of fuzzy thinking on filter bubbles, as you might expect from the chief of an engagement-algorithm-driven content distribution machine. But — for all his talk of “building global community” — he offers no clear fix for how Facebook can help break users out of the AI-enabled, navel-gazing circles its business model creates. Yet a very simple fix for this does exist — which would be to show people a chronological News Feed of friends’ posts as the default vs the current default being the algorithmically powered one. Facebook users can manually switch to a chronological feed but the option is tricky to find, and clearly actively discouraged as the choice gets reset back to the AI Feed either per session or very soon after. In short the choice barely exists. The root problem here of course is that Facebook’s business benefits massively from algorithmically engaged users. So there’s zero chance Zuck is going to announce it’s abandoning such a lucrative and (thus far) scalable default. So his solitary claim in the essay to “worry” about fake news and filter bubbles rings very hollow indeed. Indeed, there is also a risk that giving users controls over controversial content could exacerbate the filter bubble effect further. Because a user who can effectively dial down all controversy to zero is probably not going to be encountering news about conflict in Syria, say. It’s going to be a lot easier for them to live inside a padded Facebook stream populated with cute photos of babies and kittens. News? What news? Awwww, how purdy! And while that might make a pleasing experience for individuals who wants to disengage from wider global realities, it’s reductive for society as a whole if lots of people start retreating into rose-tinted filter bubbles. (Dialing up hateful content, should that also be possible via the future Facebook content filters, would also obviously likely have a deleterious and divisive societal impact). The point is, giving people easy opt outs for types of content that might push them outside their comfort zone and force them to confront unfamiliar ideas or encounter a different or difficult perspective just offers a self-enabled filter bubble (alongside the algorithmic filter Facebook users get pushed inside when inside Facebook, thanks to its default setting). This issue is of rising important given how many users Facebook has, and how the massively dominant platform has been shown to be increasingly cannibalizing traditional news media; becoming a place people go to get news generally, not just to learn what their friends are up to. And remember, all this stuff is being discussed in a post where Zuckerberg is seeking to position Facebook as the platform to glue the world together in a “global community” and at a fractious moment in history. Which would imply giving users the ability to access perspectives far-flung from their own, rather that helping people retreat into reductive digital comfort zones. A multitude of disconnected filter bubbles certainly does not have the ring of ‘global community’ to me. Another glaring omission in Zuckerberg’s writing is the risk of Facebook’s cache of highly personal (and likely increasingly sensitive) data being misused by overreaching governments seeking to clamp down on particular groups within society. It’s especially strange for a US CEO to stay silent on this at this point in time, given how social media searches by US customs agents have ramped up following President Trump’s Executive Order on immigration last month. There have also been suggestions that foreigners wanting to enter the US could be forced to hand over their social media passwords to US border agents in future. All of which has very clear and very alarming implications for Facebook users and their Facebook data. Yet the threat posed to Facebook users by government agencies appropriating accounts to enable highly intrusive, warrantless searches — and presumably go on phishing expeditions for incriminating content, perhaps, in future, as a matter of course for all foreigners traveling to the US — apparently does not merit public consideration by Facebook’s CEO. Instead, Zuckerberg is calling for more user data, and for increased use of Facebook. While clearly such calls are driven by the commercial imperatives of his business, the essay is couched as a humanitarian manifesto. So those calls seems either willfully ignorant or recklessly disingenuous. I’ll leave the last word to Bernal: “The idea that we concentrate all our stuff in one place — both in one online place (i.e. Facebook) and one physical place (i.e. our smartphones), puts us at greater risk when we have governments who are likely to take advantage of those risks. And are actually looking at doing things that will be putting us under pressure. So I think we need to be looking at diversifying, rather than looking at one particular route in. “Anyone who’s got any sense is not going to be doing anything that’s even slightly risky on Facebook,” he adds. “And should be looking for alternatives. Because while the border guards may know about Facebook and Twitter they’re not going to know about the more obscure systems, and they’re not going to be able to get access to them. So now is actually the time for us to be saying let’s do less Facebook, not more Facebook.”  \n",

            "Facebook has launched an update to Analytics for Apps, its cross-platform analytics platform for developers who want to track how their users engage with their sites, bots and apps. The promise of Analytics for Apps is that it allows developers to better understand their audience and then use this data to better engage them through push and in-app notifications. As Facebook announced today, Analytics for Apps users have integrated the service into one million apps, website and bots since its launch in 2015. Bots are obviously a rather new phenomenon, but the company added support for them into the service about three months ago. With today’s update, the company is adding two major new features to the service that will make it more useful for the product managers and marketers that may use it inside a company. The first is the ability to compare two customer segments side-by-side. Say you want to see how customers in one country are using a service compared to another country. That wasn’t very easy to do in earlier versions of the service but it now only takes a few clicks to see this data. You can also split data by which device people used, their demographics, etc.  The second new feature focused on giving users more insights into where their customers actually come from. You could already track users across desktop and mobile, but now the service also supports referring domains so you can see where your users are coming from. Analytics for Apps is far from the only player in this market, of course. Its competitors include heavyweights like Google Analytics and Google’s Firebase Analytics service as well as Mixpanel and, depending on the use case, Leanplum and others. Given the social networking service at the core of its business, Facebook, of course, promises that it can give its users better insights into their customers’ demographics than its competitors.  \n",

            "359 Facebook on course to be the WeChat of the West, says Gartner\n",
            "It’s the beginning of the end for smartphone apps as we have known and tapped on them, reckons Gartner . The analyst is calling the start of a “post-apps” era, based on changes in consumer interactions that appear driven, in large part, by the rise of dominant messaging platforms designed to consume more and more of mobile users’ time and attention. It figures messaging apps will become more popular than social media apps within the next two years. In a new report, based on a survey of mobile users in the US, China and the UK, Gartner’s reading of the app usage tea-leaves shows signs of messaging platforms cannibalizing other apps, with for example, usage of dedicated video apps declining four percentage points between the 2015 and 2016 editions of the survey. (The analyst polled just over 3,000 respondents for the 2016 survey, the results of which it’s releasing now, with the poll taking place between August 26 and October 13.) Usage of standalone maps apps also shrunk by three percentage points, year-over-year, according to Gartner’s data. And social media app usage reduced by two percentage points vs messaging app usage growing by three percentage points over the same period. Shopping (which results in something tangible being delivered), and personal assistant apps (which are designed to shortcut queries) bucked the slide, growing by four percentage points apiece. “It’s a move away from using native applications to something else,” says Gartner research director Jessica Ekholm, discussing the survey in an interview with TechCrunch. “Consumers are getting less interested in using applications; there are far too many applications. Some of the surveys that we’re doing we see that there’s a stablization in terms of app usage. How many apps they’re downloading, how much time they’re spending finding new applications — it’s just that people are getting a little bit disinterested in that. People are spending more time with the apps that they’ve already got. “The other thing is, with the digital assistants, we’re seeing that people are switching towards ‘hey I just want an answer now and quick’ — so I might as well go with a digital assistant rather than ‘oh which app is that one? Let me think… no, I’m just going to ask Siri or whoever’.” Social media losing out to messaging is not surprising when you consider how much personal sharing has migrated to more bounded/non-public messaging platform. The analyst notes how “incredibly sticky” messaging apps have become — with 72 per cent of survey respondents using these types of apps at least once per day, according to its survey data. In recent years Facebook has also made a conscious effort to drive usage of its Facebook -branded messaging app Messenger, by closing off the ability of mobile users to view Facebook messages unless they download and use the Messenger app. That strategy may have cannibalized some usage of Facebook’s main social media app but it’s clearly driven usage of Facebook Messenger — to beyond one billion monthly users. The company also owns the WhatsApp messaging platform, which also has more than a billion users and is hugely popular outside the US, in regions such as Europe and South America. In China, the homegrown WeChat  is the dominant messaging force for monopolizing mobile users’ attention, via a platform that plugs in all sorts of additional third party services, from ride-hailing to banking to food ordering. (Gartner’s poll puts WeChat’s popularity there at a staggering 95 per cent usage). This so-called ‘super app’ model was pioneered by WeChat, but players such as Facebook are clearly gunning to clone the approach for mobile users in the West — and there are signs the company is sucking the oxygen out of other apps, even if a Facebook-owned platform is not yet the only place to go for everything. Can WeChat’s ‘super app’ model be replicated in the West? After all, China’s firewalled Internet and differences in cultural attitudes could also be playing a role in WeChat’s success. But Ekholm reckons it’s only a matter of time before the US has its own WeChat-esque go-to platform. “I think it can be and I think we’re heading towards that, quite frankly,” she says, when asked if the WeChat model can be replicated. “Because it is moving towards stablization of the usage of applications, and you get into digital assistants coming in and people used to using one avenue or one channel to get information. And also what the likes of Facebook is doing — and everyone’s trying to do as well with the messaging applications that are becoming more of a platform — they’re moving in that direction. “It’s just a case of if the user experience is great others will follow because that’s what we generally see with consumers. If the user experience is great the early adopters are going to tell their friends and family, etc, etc. That’s how it goes. And then we see more early mainstream adoption, so I do think it is moving in that direction. “It’s probably not going to be as quick as it was in China, because of the[ir] mobile-first approach, but it will come… Slowly but surely over the next few years.” Facebook’s bald-faced attempt to hijack the smartphone homescreen, via the 2013 homescreen replacement app, Facebook Home, did not deliver the landgrab the company was seeking. But that earlier stumble looks to be of little consequence now given the company’s rising success in dominating the smartphone experience via an indirect strategy focused on ramping up the stickiness and functionality of its various social and messaging platforms to keep users playing within its walled gardens. And monopolizing people’s time and attention via a suite of increasingly dominant platforms ultimately has the same effect as a physical takeover of the third party app space on their handset’s homescreen. Acquisition has also clearly been key to Facebook’s success in pulling users away from rival platforms, with both WhatsApp  and Instagram brought into the Facebook fold — adding billions of users and expanding the walls of its empire. (And while Snapchat is the big one that got away, Facebook is working to close down that threat by aggressively cloning its functionality — a strategy that appears to be bearing fruit.) “They’ve got a billion users on Facebook Messenger alone, and WhatsApp on a billion as well,” notes Ekholm, when asked whether she sees Facebook as the inevitable messaging platform winner in the West. “So it’s really just a question of time. And the user experience has to be there. It has to go beyond the kind of usual ‘order a pizza by Dominos’ / ‘order a cab over Uber’. That gets a little bit tiring now.” There will also still be room for apps to live within Facebook’s walled gardens, of course, albeit as more minor bots/chatbots vs standalone properties. So manager your expectations, developers. And here Ekholm sees AI playing an increasing role in how users will discover services in the Facebook-dominated future. “It will be contextualized services. So you’ll get marketing messages floating up depending on who you are and what you’re asking for as well. So it’s not going to be just the main providers — it’s going to be those ones that you’re requesting. That’s going to be using artificial intelligence that many marketeers are going to be using for their branded apps as well.” She reckons AI is one area where developers can still make some kind of dent in the digital universe — despite messaging being monopolized by increasingly powerful platform giants. “There’s always going to be an appetite for something new, something more exciting,” she argues. “But it has to be an excellent user experience, it has to be something exciting… There are some very interesting new digital assistants… There’s a Spanish digital assistant called Sherpa that do some really exciting stuff. “It’s kind of creating that contextual, seamless experience. So a digital assistant that truly knows who you are, what you’re doing, what kind of boundaries you’re setting in terms of privacy, information, location and those kinds of things. We’re really not there yet with any application so I think there’s a whole ground yet to be discovered.” “Even if we’re talking about the post-app era, there’s still going to be opportunities for something new,” she adds. “Will a new application get a billion users? Probably not. But if you get a few hundred thousand you might be acquired.” Virtual personal assistants (VPAs) are another growth area flagged up in the survey — though one Facebook is also addressing (with a built-in assistant within Messenger, called M). And it remains to be seen whether VPAs will ultimately just be folded into messaging platforms as another function within the walled garden. Or whether voice-driven assistants could themselves prove to be powerful and disruptive enough to spark a major shift away from smartphone screens (via hands-free devices such as Apple’s AirPods or the Amazon Echo connected speaker, for instance) — to put a noticeable dent in messaging platforms’ dominance. Gartner has previously flagged rising consumer interest in voice-driven devices and services. For this app survey it was specifically looking at smartphone-based VPAs, where it found that Siri and Google Now are the most used among US and UK respondents. So Facebook has ground to make up there — without the advantage of being able to bake its assistant into the mobile OS. Primary uses for VPAs which the analyst identified from survey responses are checking the weather forecast (70 per cent); finding nearby/popular places (44 per cent); and reading breaking news or other news stories (44 per cent). Which suggests these digital assistants are not in danger of cannibalizing the primary use-case of messaging platforms: i.e. communication. The analyst does reckon VPAs have the potential to replace some “traditional apps”, as it puts it — by offering a shortcut to get “fast information in a consolidated manner” vs tapping to open a weather app, for example. But such a utilitarian focus for VPAs does not suggest much to upset the addictive catnip of socializing en masse — and in glorious multimedia — that continues at vast and growing scale on multiple messaging platforms. At least, not for now. Still, VPAs do appear to have a place or a role to play in an information-overloaded world. Overall the analyst found a substantial majority (71 per cent) of respondents use them at least once per week. Although Ekholm also noted some noticeable differences in usage frequency across the three countries, with usage highest in the US — where 42 per cent of respondents said they use VPAs daily (vs just 28 per cent who do so in China, and 30 per cent in the UK). Another driver of a post-apps era that Ekholm pointed to is the need for consumers to control multiple connected devices — such as in a smart home scenario — where an ‘apps for everything’ approach not only does not work, but is actively counterproductive. “Are people wanting to have a one-app, one-ecosystem kind of approach? Yes, we’re seeing that more and more in terms of home automation and the connected home aspect… If there’s one application for every single smart plug… that’s not a sustainable future,” she says. “That’s another sub-trend that we’re seeing — as in, there needs to be more integration in the app world than there currently is.”  \n",

            "360 Learn how to design for privacy and security from Facebook’s Benjamin Strahs\n",
            "Freshly launched startups often don’t have the funding for a fully formed security team, but a data breach or a privacy overreach can be deadly for a new company. That’s why Facebook  security engineer Benjamin Strahs is joining TechCrunch at our D.C. meetup and pitch-off this week: He’ll offer advice to founders about how to bootstrap a secure culture at their companies. Facebook is a social media company, not a security firm — but, considering the wealth of personal data it holds, security has to be a consideration for everything Facebook does. Facebook has over the past few years rolled out encrypted messaging, secure browsing and new account authentication and recovery methods to make sure users’ data stays safe. Facebook also routinely tests its own systems for vulnerabilities and invites the public to do the same through its bug bounty program. But smaller companies don’t always have the financial or engineering resources for new privacy features and security programs — which is why Strahs encourages founders to use open-source frameworks and centralize their risk so they can address it more easily. Strahs has led education initiatives for his non-technical co-workers, teaching them how to recognize phishing schemes and other suspicious behavior. It’s not just about securing your infrastructure — you have to make sure your employees understand how to keep themselves secure and how to protect user data. Our conversation with Strahs comes at a time when security and privacy are more urgent than ever — digital surveillance is being debated in court, massive breaches are coming to light and privacy policy changes are spurring backlash. It will be a great discussion, and we hope you’ll join us at the meetup! Get your tickets today.  \n",

            "361 Snap takes aim at Facebook in roadshow video\n",
            "Snap is about to embark on its investor roadshow as it prepares to go public at the beginning of March. And a new video gives a glimpse at how they will be trying to persuade Wall Street to buy shares. The video starts off with CEO Evan Spiegel  emphasizing their mission as a “camera company.” He compares Snap’s video experience to Alexander Graham Bell’s invention of the telephone. “Snapchat really tapped into that human desire to communicate in a way that feels like its face-to-face even if you’re far way.” With co-founder and CTO Bobby Murphy,  the two reflect on the early days of the company and why they felt that photos should “delete by default.” Spiegel said that because the photos vanish, “there isn’t pressure to feel pretty or perfect. Self-expression isn’t a contest.” But it wasn’t long before they took some digs at other social media and how their mission differs. In what seems like a reference to Facebook, Snap said they were inspired to create its “stories” feature, partly because they didn’t like how other news feeds were in reverse chronological order. “You were always scrolling backwards through a story and that didn’t really make sense to us.” This is a sensitive topic for Snap. Facebook-owned Instagram recently copied “stories,” which seemingly put a damper on Snap’s growth. Snap suggests that “bigger isn’t better,” when it comes to number of friends on social media, another likely aim at Facebook. They emphasized that Snap users tend to add fewer friends on the app, which makes for a more intimate experience. In what appears to be a reference to Facebook’s “fake news” problem, Snap highlighted their curated publisher stories. On other platforms, “wacky headlines” would get distributed widely, but the “more informative would get buried,” said Spiegel.  “That editorial perspective was missing.” Instead of Facebook’s early motto of “move fast and break things,” Spiegel highlighted a more calculated approach. “It’s not a throw things at the wall and see what sticks kind of company,” he said. “We try to take time to really listen to what our community wants from our products.” The video also reiterates Snap’s usage numbers, where 158 million users are on the app everyday, on average logging in 18 times, or 25-30 minutes per day. The video also talks about their road to profitability, which is likely a long way off. You can watch the 35-minute video here.  \n",

            "362 Facebook plans customizable filters for nudity and violence\n",
            "Facebook  wants to give you the power to define what is and isn’t objectionable, and influence the local defaults of those who don’t choose voluntarily. You’ll eventually be able to select how much nudity, violence, graphic content and profanity you’re comfortable seeing. Mark Zuckerberg revealed this massive shift in Facebook’s Community Standards policy today in his 5,000-word humanitarian manifesto, which you can read our highlights and analysis of here. Currently, Facebook relies on a one-size-fits-most set of standards about what’s allowed on the network. The only exception is that it abides by local censorship laws. But that’s led to trouble for Facebook, as newsworthy historical photos including nudity and citizen journalism accounts of police violence have been wrongly removed, then restored after media backlash or executive review. Zuckerberg explains the forthcoming policy, writing: “The idea is to give everyone in the community options for how they would like to set the content policy for themselves. Where is your line on nudity? On violence? On graphic content? On profanity? What you decide will be your personal settings. We will periodically ask you these questions to increase participation and so you don’t need to dig around to find them. For those who don’t make a decision, the default will be whatever the majority of people in your region selected, like a referendum. Of course you will always be free to update your personal settings anytime. With a broader range of controls, content will only be taken down if it is more objectionable than the most permissive options allow.” This approach allows Facebook to give vocal, engaged users choice, while establishing reasonable localized norms, without ever forcing specific policies on anyone or requiring all users to configure complicated settings. To classify potentially objectionable content Facebook will lean more heavily on artificial intelligence, which is already delivering 30 percent of all content flags to its human reviewers. Over time, Zuckerberg hopes Facebook’s AI will learn to make nuanced distinctions, such as between terrorist propaganda and a news report about a terrorist attack. There are still plenty of questions about how this system will work. For example, what happens to teens? Do they get strict defaults or the same control, and do parents have license to select their kids’ settings? And we don’t know when this will launch, though Zuckerberg implied it would all take time. This new system of governance could make Facebook’s policies feel less overt, as they should align with local norms. It might also be a boon to certain content creators, such as photographers or painters who make nude art, videographers who capture action or war or unfiltered pundits with niche views. Personalized and localized site governance might prove more democratic than treating Facebook as one giant country. Its 2012 experiment with allowing people to vote on policies failed and was scrapped because it required 30 percent of a users to vote on long, complicated documents of changes for their majority decision to be binding. The final vote would have needed 300 million votes to be binding, but received just 619,000. Now users who don’t “vote” on their settings receive the local defaults, “like a referendum” in a U.S. state.  Zuckerberg also outlined several other product development plans. Facebook hopes to add more suggestions for local Groups to tie users deeper into their communities. Facebook will also give Group leaders more tools, akin to what Facebook provides Page owners. Zuckerberg didn’t provide specifics, but those features might include analytics about what content is engaging, the ability to set more types of admins and moderators or the option to add outside app functionality. As far as safety and information, Facebook wants to expand AI detection of bullying or self-harm, and potentially allow people to report mental health issues, disease or crime. And to fight polarization and sensationalism, not just objectively fake news, it wants to present users with a range of sources across the political spectrum about a given topic. That could potentially come through showing Related Articles on links that draw on sources from other parts of the spectrum. The central theme of these changes is Facebook empowering users to define their own experience. It wants to see the world move toward a supportive, safe, informed, civically engaged and inclusive global community. But it still sees itself as just a tool, with the direction of progress defined by those who wield it.  \n",

            "363 Facebook’s new job opening posts poach business from LinkedIn\n",
            "LinkedIn has neglected two big opportunities Facebook  is now capitalizing on: helping lower-skilled workers and people who aren’t actively looking for a job. Today Facebook is rolling out a slew of new Jobs features we spotted it testing last year. They could hurt LinkedIn’s growth prospects and divert recruiting ad dollars. Business Pages will now be able to post job openings to the News Feed through the status update composer, and host them on a Jobs tab on their Page. When users see these, they can hit an “Apply Now” button to instantly send an application through Facebook Messenger. Facebook will pre-fill the user’s name and profile picture to speed up the process. These features are now becoming available to all U.S. and Canada business Pages.  Facebook also could start earning revenue from the feature, as businesses can pay to turn these posts into ads so they reach more people in the feed. Businesses could also get some viral help as users re-share openings to their friends, or tag people that they know are looking for a job. Facebook’s VP of Ads and Business Platform Andrew “Boz” Bosworth tells me the company wanted to see “How can we make Facebook more useful in your everyday life?” They found small businesses were having trouble hiring, and most people are open to a better, higher-paying job, even if they’re satisfied with their current employment.  That’s where LinkedIn has fallen short. It’s become a destination for purposeful job seekers looking for medium- and high-skilled roles. But for people seeking part-time or hourly jobs, LinkedIn’s focus on your resume and education might have made them hesitant to sign up, and it’s not designed for applying to lots of jobs en masse. And unless you’re unemployed or actively seeking a new job, you might not have a reason to visit LinkedIn. Yet these people and the businesses looking to hire them are on Facebook every day. A News Feed post or ad can reach a job candidate who didn’t even know they were interested in switching companies. And the “Apply Now” button makes sending your application through Facebook a quick and seamless part of your socializing experience.  There is one problem: Some job applicants are skittish about employers doing background checks on their social media profiles. Applying directly through Facebook might make that even easier for a company. But Boz says research has shown “overwhelming enthusiasm” for the product. While social background checks may scare high-skilled workers applying for competitive jobs at elite companies, he says “causal job seekers … they’re just looking for every opportunity they can get.” Eventually Facebook says it will consider doing more relevancy sorting of Jobs posts and the tab to show people roles that match their education level or work experience. There are also opportunities in recruiting if Facebook allowed a company’s existing employees or viewers of these posts to see which of their friends might be a good fit for an opening. If the Messenger channel becomes popular for receiving applications, it may also need tools to help those hiring manage all their inbound interest.  For now, though, Facebook’s opportunity is showing jobs to people (the now Microsoft-owned) LinkedIn forgot. “Two-thirds of job seekers are already employed,” says Boz. “They’re not spending their days and nights out there canvassing for jobs. They’re open to a job if a job comes.” While LinkedIn might be the leader in the employment social network space, its 467 million user count is dwarfed by Facebook’s 1.86 billion. And Facebook’s users come back every day for a variety of reasons, giving them a chance to serendipitously hear about and apply for a dream job they didn’t know they wanted.  \n",

            "364 Facebook is still figuring out how to tackle fake news\n",
            "Facebook  realizes that “fake news” is a problem, but is still a long way from figuring out how to solve it. At CODE Media today, Facebook VP of partnerships Dan Rose said combatting fake news is “something that’s really important to us,” but acknowledged that the company is “just getting started” and “there’s a lot of work we can do.” In a world where people’s perceptions of reality are being shaped largely by what appears in their social feeds, some people have argued that companies like Facebook have a responsibility to ensure they’re not being fed a steady diet of “fake news.” Facebook is moving trying to reduce the impact of sensational or misleading content showing up in users’ news feeds. Part of that is a reaction to the election of Donald Trump following the viral spread of fake election news via Facebook, which is basically the digital equivalent of shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted. But part of it is by necessity, as other nations are pressuring Facebook to clamp down on the spread of news that could be disruptive to their own elections. In Germany, which is facing a nationwide election this year, lawmakers proposed a rule that would levy a 500,000 euro fine for each piece of fake news it fails to take down within 24 hours. No surprise, then, that Germany was one of the first places where Facebook rolled out new tools to combat misleading articles being shared. Rose highlighted the steps the company has already taken to alleviate the problem, which include its effort to work with third-party fact checkers to identify misleading headlines and untrue stories. It’s also providing better tools to allow users to flag content in their feeds, and sending those stories to third-party fact checkers. Part of Facebook’s reluctance to censoring what people shares on their feeds might come from a philosophical standpoint of whether the company is, in fact, a media company. On that point, Rose demurred, saying that Facebook is a “new type of platform… where people discover a lot of media content.”  \n",

            "365 To compete with YouTube, Facebook is preparing to launch connected TV apps\n",
            "Facebook  wants its users to upload and consume more videos, and it’s making a couple of changes to the way that it displays and distributes those videos. Today at CODE Media, Facebook VP of partnerships Dan Rose said the company would also launch a series of apps for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV. For Facebook, the ability to stream on the TV is just one more step in a larger effort to make its site and apps a place where more creators want to share their videos. According to Rose, that started with autoplay video ads that appeared in the news feed, and expanded with the introduction of live and Instagram videos. Today the company announced a few changes to the way video would be displayed: First, videos will follow the audio settings of their devices — which means that if your device sound is set on, the audio will play. Second, Facebook will no longer crop vertical video, making it more like Snapchat today. Third, users will now be able to watch a video and pull it to the side of their feed while they scroll through their news feed. But the big news is the introduction of streaming apps, which will allow users to watch Facebook videos from their TVs. Rose noted that Facebook has long had the ability to AirPlay or stream videos to an Apple TV or Chromecast. With the introduction of new ways to watch video, Facebook is also signaling a move toward more professionally produced content. The company hired CollegeHumor’s Ricky Van Veen last summer, and he’s working with creators to create new kinds of content. That could put Facebook in direct competition with YouTube, as a place for creators to build community around their videos. Before it’s able to do so, however, it’ll need to find ways to provide monetization tools and pay creators for their work. It’ll also need to provide more tools for rights holders to help them fight piracy. Earlier this week, it was reported that Facebook was looking to license music from the big labels, partly in an effort to increase the number of videos shared on its site and mobile apps. While that wouldn’t make it a direct competitor to Spotify or Apple Music, it could help it compete against YouTube, which has a robust set of audio fingerprinting and ContentID tools. It could also signal a huge new revenue stream for the music labels. Given the scale of Facebook’s user base — 1.2 billion daily actives and growing! — making music more accessible on the platform could be a new promotional stream for artists. Having a platform for mobile, desktop, and now TV distribution should boost video production and viewership.  \n",

            "366 Facebook is pushing record labels to let you soundtrack your videos\n",
            "How can Facebook  and Instagram make their amateur videos more interesting than those you see on Twitter or Snapchat? A killer soundtrack. That’s why Facebook is now pressing record labels even harder for a licensing deal. Successful negotiations could allow users to either edit popular music into their creations or record clips with popular music in the background without their videos getting taken down for copyright infringement. Facebook could even build a way for people to easily select songs to add as the soundtrack to their videos, as we’ve previously suggested. Facebook has been in talks with record labels since at least 2015, when the NYT said it was looking to get music videos in to people’s feed. Some wrongly speculated that Facebook would soon launch its own full-fledged music streaming service to compete with Spotify. Billboard reported late last year that Facebook was building an anti-piracy tool for music, which would complement its Rights Manager tool that thwarts video freebooting. Now Bloomberg says Facebook has redoubled its efforts with a focus on securing copyrighted music for user-generated videos. Without these deals, Facebook has to disappoint and anger people by preventing the upload of videos or removing ones that contain label-owned music. For example, a compilation video of moments from a family vacation set to Dad’s favorite classic rock tune might not be allowed. Or a silly clip of friends goofing around in a car could get taken down because it picked up the radio playing a hit song in the background. That can discourage users from creating videos for Facebook in the future, depriving the social network of its most vivid and monetizable content.  YouTube addressed this same problem with its Content ID system. It detects the use of copyrighted music and gives the music’s owner the option to have the video removed, or become the beneficiary of a revenue share from ads shown with the video. That second option is widely preferable because users don’t get their videos annoyingly removed, artists gain grassroots promotion for their music and labels earn a fee in exchange for the art they own. Facebook already built its own audio fingerprinting technology that it unveiled in 2014 to automatically show you songs you’re listening to or shows you’re watching so you could tag them in a status update. Now it’s a matter of striking an agreeable deal with the labels so they can get paid for video soundtracks. If the labels are smart, they’ll find some way to make it work rather than letting these distribution and revenue options go to waste. Facebook just hired former director of Google and YouTube music partnerships Tamara Hrivnak to lead its music strategy and work with the labels.  The question is whether Facebook can draw a line between incidental uses of music, where a song is more of an accompaniment to a video, and deliberate piracy, where the video is really just a place-holder so users can search and listen to a song for free. The latter practice that some record execs despise is common on YouTube. Forging a deal for music accompaniment to legitimate user-generated videos could open the door to a deeper partnership with labels around professional music videos. Facebook could also gain leverage over labels and open sponsorship opportunities by creating a feature that suggests particular songs for people to use as soundtracks. But for now, Facebook is just trying to remove any growth obstacles from its current blockbuster product. Most people aren’t great videographers, let alone sound engineers. User-generated videos can be boring to watch and sound awful. But with the right song, suddenly those shaky party clips and stiff landscape panoramas become epic.  \n",

            "Following multiple admissions last year that it had been misreporting some of its ad numbers, Facebook just announced that it has committed to an audit by the Media Rating Council “to verify the accuracy of the information we deliver to our partners.” The mistakes that Facebook  revealed last year seem relatively minor, but collectively, they probably have added momentum to calls from the ad industry for better data from Facebook, as well as more third-party verification of that data.  In the blog post announcing the MRC audit, Facebook also says it will be providing more details about how long (down to the millisecond) an ad is actually on-screen, as well as how long 50 percent and 100 percent of the ad is on-screen. So hopefully, advertisers will wonder less about whether they’re paying for ads that aren’t actually seen. In addition, Facebook says it’s now working with 24 independent partners for ad measurement. Plus, it will be adding new video ad-buying options — for example, advertisers could only pay for videos that are viewed in their entirety. “As a partner to over four million advertisers across a wide range of organizations and objectives, we want to provide transparency, choice, and accountability,” Facebook says.  \n",

            "Facebook is rolling out a useful new feature that puts a full weather forecast inside its mobile app and desktop site. The feature is accessible from News Feed or the mobile app’s “More” menu — the section that links you to areas like Friends, Events, Groups, Pages and other key Facebook features like On This Day or Saved items. Within the Weather section, you can view a full forecast for your week ahead, powered by data from Weather.com. Facebook confirmed that the new feature, an updated version of its earlier “weather greetings,” has launched to around 95 percent of its global population as of this week. This is not the first time Facebook has toyed with introducing weather information into its service. The company years ago added forecasts to events and public places, and more recently was spotted testing weather updates in its News Feed in the U.K.  A year ago, Facebook also rolled out “weather greetings” in News Feed, which were short, informational weather updates that appeared at the top of your feed in the morning. The new feature is an extension on that. You’ll now see similar messages at the top of the News Feed with a link to the full, five-day forecast. These News Feed “greetings” will appear on both desktop and mobile, Facebook tells us. Even if you miss the greeting, you can visit the Weather section in the app, where it exists as a new menu item. In addition, Facebook will now offer an option to set notifications for receiving weather reports. The company says that Notifications and the more detailed greetings are rolling out for tests now, with all these updates being widely available by the end of the month.  The Weather section will default to your current location, but you can click the Settings wheel in the top right to add other locations you want to track, just like any other weather app. You also can choose to display the temperatures in either Fahrenheit or Celsius. However, you can’t swipe through your multiple locations once they’re set up, as you could in a typical app like Yahoo Weather or Apple’s Weather app — instead, if you want to change to a different location you have to return to the Settings and tap the one you want to view. The weather information provided is fairly basic — it’s just the highs and lows, along with the general forecast, like sunny, partly cloudy, etc. At the top of the Weather page, you also can see the daily forecast by the hour, as is common in most weather apps today. The information for the forecast comes from Weather.com’s API. The site also is linked at the bottom of the screen where it says “See more weather info,” followed by an icon indicating a new window will open if clicked.  The cute, cartoon-style heading at the top of the page also will update based on the forecast. For example, a rainy day in San Francisco right now shows a picture of deer hiding out under a tree. Meanwhile, New York’s currently partly cloudy day shows puffy clouds over green grass, with a bird hiding in the bushes. (See above graphics). This makes the feature feel more personalized, and Facebook-like, as the company has been using similar drawings in its News Feed informational messages for some time. The addition is now one of several new bookmarks Facebook has rolled out to its mobile app in recent days, following useful utilities like its “Wi-Fi finder,” a new networking (or even dating) section called “Discover People” and now Weather. Seemingly, the goal with the new feature is to keep Facebook users in the app by offering them the information they would otherwise need to look for elsewhere, while also offering similar experiences to those that are found in other third-party mobile applications today. Facebook, however, says it’s more about delighting users instead. “We are doing this because our goal is to develop products that connect people to the things they care about most and create moments of joy in people’s day, like simply telling you that it’s going to rain later,” a spokesperson said.

            "Facebook announced in November that it would stop advertisers from targeting users by race for ads that focused on housing, employment, and credit opportunities, in response to a report that found that Facebook’s  tools could be used to place discriminatory advertisements. Today, the social network provided a progress update on the matter, disclosing what actions it has taken since its announcement was first made, along with details of its new advertising policies and related tools. Thanks to Facebook’s treasure trove of user data, advertisers on its site have been able to narrowly target users by a variety of factors, like age, location, gender, religion, and more. These microtargeting capabilities have been used for years in a number of ways, including, most recently in the U.S. presidential election to reach niche audiences with political ads customized to their own interests. However, Facebook came under fire last fall because those same ad targeting capabilities were being used to include or exclude users from ad campaigns based on their “ethnic affinity,” –meaning race. Excluding certain races from housing and employment ads put the company in violation of anti-discrimination laws, including the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Propublica’s report pointed out at the time. The social network responded by saying it would disable ethnic affinity ad targeting for the ads that involved housing, employments or credit. Facebook says it met with policymakers and civil rights leaders to gather feedback about what needed to be done, and has since made several changes. The company’s new advertising policy now more clearly prohibits discrimination by spelling out that advertisers cannot discriminate against people based on “personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, family status, disability, medical or genetic condition,” the company explains today in a blog post about the new policies and features. Additionally, Facebook is now linking to a new educational section from its Ad Policies page which offers more information along with other educational resources from places like government agencies and civil rights groups specializing in combating discrimination. Beyond just spelling out what not to do, Facebook says it’s also beginning a test of new enforcement tools that will help it to identify ads that are in violation of its policies. Specifically, these tools will identify housing, employment and credit opportunity ads and determine if they either include or exclude multicultural advertising segments – which are those consisting of people interested in seeing content related to the African-American, Asian American and U.S. Hispanic communities. If the ads are, in fact, including or excluding these segments, Facebook says it will disapprove the ad.  An informational message will alert the advertiser of the violation, so they can correct the problem if need be. In the case of a false positive, the advertiser can also click a button for a manual review.  Advertisers who are posting ads for housing, employment and credit, but are targeting other audience segments on Facebook, will be also be asked to click a button to certify that they understand the updated anti-discrimination policy. Doing so pops up a window where the advertiser must read through the policy details, then agree that they will abide by its terms. They must check a box and then click “Accept” to continue.  The company says it worked with several groups during the creation of its new policies and tools, and gave thanks in its post to the following: New York State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman; Members of the Congressional Black Caucus including Chairman Cedric Richmond, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, Rep. Yvette D. Clarke, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, II, and Rep. Robin Kelly; the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham; Rep. David N. Cicilline, Co-Chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus; the American Civil Liberties Union; the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; the Center for Democracy & Technology; the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; the National Fair Housing Alliance; the Brookings Institution; and Upturn. Additionally, many of the organizations pressed Facebook for the opportunity to work with the company further on ways that ad technology could be used instead to promote inclusion and  opportunity for the underserved communities, in addition to protecting against discriminatory uses. “We believe in the power of our advertising products to create opportunities for people from all backgrounds, so we are committed to working with these groups toward that goal,” Facebook said, referencing those requests. However, it didn’t provide any information on what steps it may be taking next on that front at this time.  \n",

            "Facebook’s stripped-down but speedy Lite app is growing fast and adding countries so it can keep connecting people and building the company’s business in the low-bandwidth world where revenue increased 52% this year. Facebook Lite launched in June 2015, it rocketed to 100 million monthly users by March 2016, and now it’s doubled in size to 200 million users, Mark Zuckerberg says. And that’s just in a limited set of countries which today expands to include Israel, Italy, United Arab Emirates, and South Korea. Meanwhile COO Sheryl Sandberg points out the app now lets businesses manage their Pages. Facebook Lite is partly why the social giant has managed to boost its business in the Rest Of World region.  Average revenue per user is up 28% this year from $1.10 to $1.41. And that pushed its Rest Of World revenue up 52% this year to $839 million per quarter. By making it enjoyable for users to sign up and spend more time on Facebook even with a weak network connection, Facebook is starting to make money in places other apps don’t. For example, Snapchat’s bandwidith-heavy video-first app earned just $7.8 million off 39 million daily users in the Rest Of World region all year — and unlike Facebook, Snap includes Asia Pacific in Rest Of World. The startup cited how it grows much better it countries with high-bandwidth.  But rather than wait for the developing world’s network infrastructure to increase bandwidth, Facebook shrunk its app into a Lite version.  \n",

            "Facebook gave Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren a voice late last night when her Senate colleagues attempted to silence her on the floor. As Democrats rally against many of Trump’s cabinet nominations, an arcane rule was whipped out of Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s pocket, silencing Sen. Warren’s argument against the appointment of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. So she took to Facebook Live to make her point, a video which has now totaled more than 6.2 million views. In session, Sen. Warren read aloud a pair of letters written by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s widow, Coretta Scott King, and late Senator Edward Kennedy. These letters were penned in 1986 when Sessions was up for a federal judgeship. In response, Sen. McConnell invoked Rule XIX, which was originally added in 1902 in the wake of a fist-fight in the Senate. The rule states: “No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.” To be clear, Sen. Warren was merely reading words written by a civil rights icon, who was opposing Sessions’ appointment to a federal judgeship in 1986. After being shut down, Sen. Warren took matters into her own hands. She hit that Live button on Facebook and read the letter to all of Facebook. The video has now been seen more than 6.2 million times. You can check it out here: Even more interesting, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico read the same letter and wasn’t silenced at all, begging the question of whether or not Sen. Warren was simply silenced because of her gender. Facebook may blur the lines between verified news and fake news and misinformation, but it also opens up a direct line of communication between citizens and public officials. Though we, as citizens, can’t vote on the appointment of Jeff Sessions to Attorney General, we can directly communicate with the Senators who hold that power. As we move further into the Trump presidency, it seems that live streams on Facebook and Periscope will continue to be used as tools for dissent in Congress.  \n",

In the post, Sandberg noted her own experience as a mother and the “nightmare” surrounding the unexpected death of her husband in shaping her perspective. “Starting today, Facebook employees will have up to 20 days paid leave to grieve an immediate family member, up to 10 days to grieve an extended family member, and will be able to take up to six weeks of paid leave to care for a sick relative,” Sandberg writes. “We’re also introducing paid family sick time – three days to take care of a family member with a short-term illness, like a child with the flu.” Facebook currently offers four months of paid leave for new parents, moms and dads alike. That puts the company on the leading edge of the curve, given that the U.S. consistently ranks in the bottom by most measures of paid parental leave, though some states are taking measures to change that. For all of the criticism the industry faces around issues of diversity and inclusion, which it for the most part still hasn’t figured out, tech has blazed some notable trails in employee benefits. Though that might conjure images of nap pods and well-stocked cereal selections, in recent years tech companies have moved to make their full-time worker benefits some of the most robust around. Those same protections rarely extend to contract workers and anyone working that sharing economy hustle, but they’re certainly a solid start. In 2015, Amazon responded to intense criticism around its implementation of maternity leave (among many other corporate culture red flags) by reworking its policies. A few months later, Netflix introduced unlimited parental leave, though unlimited leave, like unlimited vacation, doesn’t always live up to its name. And of course, Mark Zuckerberg publicly committed to his own company’s parenting policies by taking two months off from running Facebook after the birth of his daughter Max. For the rest of the context for Facebook’s new policies, Sandberg’s full post is embedded below.  \n",

            "373 How to make Facebook politics less painful\n",
            "I made just one innocent political comment and it practically started a war. The conversation quickly escalated until my conservative aunt Karen was yelling at Chris, a left-leaning friend from high school. Once Karen stopped yelling, Chris responded with a thoughtful, tempered response –except for the thinly veiled Hitler reference at the end of it. In truth, Karen and Chris have never met in person, and they live thousands of miles apart; this encounter happened on Facebook (names changed for this essay). I have seen dozens of similar conflicts in the past few months and admit to shamelessly engaging in some myself. Yet, if Karen and Chris had met face to face, I think their conversation would have gone differently. The social norms of in-person communication clearly don’t exist online, and Facebook is limited by constraints of design, structure and algorithms — constraints that don’t exist in person. So how can Facebook make politics less painful? Let’s take a look at four behavioral design strategies Facebook could use to facilitate discourse and help you avoid offending a good friend’s aunt! In the middle of a heated conversation, we sometimes forget we’re talking to a person, not a target. What’s worse is that most of the people we encounter on Facebook are connected to us within two or three degrees. Karen and Chris are just two degrees apart, with me as their mutual connection. Before emotions lead them to start verbally assaulting each other, they need subtle reminders: “Max likes and trusts this person… maybe I should give them the benefit of the doubt.” Facebook can do more than just indicate that I am a mutual friend; it can contextualize the relationship and make that information visible as the conversation occurs. I’ve encountered this situation myself: As I angrily began crafting an argument in response to some woman I thought was “clearly irrational,” I realized I was going head to head with my good friend’s mom! This realization instantly diffused my emotions. I edited the “snide” out of my remarks and, while I still disagreed with her stance, we had a pleasant, productive conversation. What it could look like:  In a 2008 research study, radiologists were presented with photos of their patients as they analyzed x-rays for those respective patients. This tweak helped humanize the radiologists’ work, and, as a result, they felt more empathy toward their patients. To the benefit of the patients, the radiologists were also more meticulous in their analyses when presented with the photos. While photos abound on Facebook, they seem to have found second-tier status in comments, as they’ve been reduced to a few hardly visible pixels. Applying the principles from the radiology study, Facebook could make photos (specifically faces) much more noticeable. If the psychological effect from the radiology study holds here, larger profile images would encourage users to have empathy and be more deliberate and “meticulous” with their comments. Current Facebook:  Revised for empathy:  The last time you met someone new, you probably followed a familiar pattern of questioning: What’s your name? Where are you from? What do you do? When we meet new people, we assimilate who they are within the context of our own personalities. We quickly filter through questions to determine how they are like us. The rote conversation veers off course as soon as we find a shared connection. “Oh, you live in Ohio? I grew up in Ohio…” In this sense, introductions are a methodical checklist to uncover shared interests, and research studies have proven that shared interests are the basis for friendship in online networks. Unfortunately, Facebook interactions don’t often lead with introductions. Your first exposure to someone might be a comment that hotly contradicts your own beliefs, while the reality may be that you have much more in common with that person than you realize. When you hover over a name or photo in Facebook’s News feed, a small profile box appears so you can see a mini-introduction to that person. However, information such as “9 new posts,” which Facebook currently displays in the profile box, doesn’t seem very useful. Instead, Facebook should mention mutual friends (as it currently does) and introduce mutual interests. Isn’t that more friendly? Even something as simple as the heart icon in this example could have a positive psychological influence on users as they formulate opinions about strangers. Normal profile box:  Revised for mutual interests:  A few months ago, I observed a particularly awkward Facebook conversation that escalated way too quickly — something we’ve all seen. My friend John (name changed) shared a political opinion in a post, then a friend of a friend reacted with personal attacks, logical fallacies and the whole arsenal of troll techniques. Rather than feeding the flames, John simply deferred, saying “It looks like we have different opinions, but more importantly I respect you as a person and your right to express your beliefs.” And that was the end of the conversation… or so I thought. Instead, the troll doubled down! More personal attacks, more flawed logic — and John was left wondering whether he should remove the post altogether.  A simple Facebook feature could empower users to more easily moderate their posts: disabling comments. This way, when Karen and Chris start arguing, and I begin to feel uncomfortable with how they’re talking to each other, I don’t have to remove the post completely. After all, it’s my post, why should I allow Karen and Chris to commandeer it? At the same time, I don’t want to delete their comments because I’m afraid they might feel like I singled them out. Instead, I could just disable comments. Facebook already allows you to turn off notifications for a particular post, so disabling comments is a natural step to empower the owner of the post. Other platforms, including YouTube and Instagram, allow you to disable comments, so it’s not clear why Facebook avoids it, and I certainly think it would be a useful feature in this context. These are just a few ideas to apply behavioral design in a way that might improve debate on Facebook. Do you think they would work? What ideas have I missed? I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thanks to Tookie Graham, Sagar Doshi, and Dustin Skinner for reading versions of this article.  \n",

            "Don’t we all love developer conferences. Facebook  just opened the (virtual) doors of its annual F8 event on April 18-19. You’ll need to apply before February 21. And if you get selected, tickets cost $595. Facebook already announced that the company would switch things up a bit with F8 in 2017. When the company shared the dates of the conference, it also said that the conference would happen for the first time in San Jose instead of San Francisco — there just isn’t enough space in San Francisco for F8 anymore. As usual, you can expect keynotes showcasing some brand new product features. In addition to that, Facebook already shared a preliminary agenda with more than 50 developer sessions. If your company relies on Facebook APIs and tools, this is a good way to keep up with updates. And of course, developers will be able to talk with Facebook engineers about their work. This way, you can directly get feedback and ask for new features in a specific API or product. If you apply but don’t get a ticket, there will be live streams.  \n",

            "375 Legal challenge to Facebook EU-US data transfer mechanism kicks off in Ireland\n",
            "Another legal challenge to a data transfer authorization mechanism relied upon by Facebook  and thousands of other companies to legally move user data from the European Union to the U.S. for processing has kicked off in the Irish High Court today. The hearing is expected to last three weeks, and is taking place in Ireland because Facebook’s European headquarters are located in the country. Last May the Irish data protection commissioner said it was referring standard contractual clauses (SCCs) — sometimes referred to as “model contract clauses” — to Ireland’s High Court to seek a referral to Europe’s top court, the CJEU, for a definitive ruling on the legality of the mechanism. In a recent memo about the action, the Irish DPA writes on its website: The DPC [data protection commissioner] is now asking the High Court to make a reference to the CJEU in relation to the validity of the SCCs mechanism. This step has been taken because the DPC has concerns as to the validity of the SCCs when considered in the light of a number of factors, to include Articles 7, 8 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and the CJEU’s judgment in the first Schrems case. The DPC considers that the concerns she holds, and the concerns expressed by Mr Schrems in a complaint filed with the DPC’s office, are well-founded. Covering the opening of the hearing today, Reuters reports that the lawyer for Commissioner Helen Dixon argued the court should refer the case to the CJEU if “you share her doubts.” “The Commissioner’s concern is simply to get it right, not to advocate for any particular result,” he added. In a statement provided to TechCrunch, a Facebook spokesperson said: “Standard Contract Clauses provide critical safeguards, protecting EU citizens data’ in the US and around the world, and are used by thousands of companies to do business. Facebook firmly believes that SCCs are integral to businesses of all sizes, and upholding them is critical to ensuring the economy can continue to grow without disruption.” The company will be giving evidence as part of the hearing — and was named in the original and updated complaints to the Irish DPA, the latter having resulted in today’s hearing. “While there is no immediate impact for people or businesses who use our services, we are pleased to have the opportunity to provide input in this process,” the Facebook spokesperson added. “It is essential that the court has the opportunity to consider the full facts before it makes any decision that may impact the European economy.” Back in June, the U.S. government asked, and was granted, permission to be joined as an amicus in the case — highlighting the high-level importance being attached to trying to prevent another data transfer challenge ending up at the CJEU, where judges would again be testing the legal robustness of a mechanism used to smooth data flows between Europe and the U.S. for e-commerce purposes. In October 2015, the court caused a big upheaval for businesses by invalidating a prior EU-U.S. data flow arrangement that had been operational for 15 years. Model contract clauses are one of the alternative data transfer mechanisms that thousands of companies fell back on when that prior arrangement, Safe Harbor, was struck down. The challenge had been initiated by European privacy campaigner Max Schrems, armed with intel from the 2013 Snowden disclosures about U.S. government surveillance programs. After the CJEU’s Safe Harbor ruling, Schrems resubmitted his complaint to the Irish DPA to push for a similar decision to invalidate SCCs. The crux of the legal question remains whether U.S. surveillance activity can be made compatible with European privacy law. And since the fall of Safe Harbor, the legality of alternative mechanisms, including model contracts, has been questioned, even as the European Commission and the U.S. went on to conclude negotiations and seal a replacement deal, called Privacy Shield. That mechanism launched last August, but is now facing at least one legal challenge. It’s also due its first annual review this summer, with signs of some early discontent on the European side — even before you factor in the question of how compatible the new Trump administration’s priorities will be with subtle arrangements seeking to legally bridge gaps in two distinct data protection regimes. The new U.S. president signing an executive order at the end of last month to strip certain privacy rights from non-citizens/non-residents certainly has terrible optics from a European perspective. Even if that particular Trump pen stroke did not invalidate Privacy Shield, which relies on a different U.S. law to underpin its promise of “essential equivalence” of privacy protections. (Though how the ongoing combination of Trump plus Privacy Shield plays out over the longer run remains an open question.) TechCrunch understands that a key concern for the Irish DPA over model contract clauses is a structural issue pertaining to the lack of redress facilities for European citizens wanting to pursue claims in the U.S. against companies they believe have breached their European rights. Privacy Shield does offer a redress path for EU citizens, enabled by the U.S. signing the Judicial Redress Act into law and extending its designation to countries in the EU — although critics argue the redress path may be too complex for European consumers to be effective.  \n",

            "376 Google and Facebook partner for anti-fake news drive during French election\n",
            "The first round of the French presidential election is due to be held in April. So it’s no coincidence that Google  and Facebook are stepping up efforts locally to combat the circulation of so-called fake news as the democratic drum beat cranks up — partnering on a collaborative initiative aimed at combating the spread of disinformation online. Google, via its News Lab arm, is backing a collaborative verification platform called CrossCheck, that will launch in France on February 27 and continue through the French elections — bringing together a raft of local media companies to power a website where members of the public can report content they believe to be dubious, or ask questions for CrossCheck’s media partners to respond to. The tech companies will be providing data and tools to help spot potential viral fakes pertaining to the election. The Cross Check project is led by First Draft News, a not-for-profit which counts Google’s News Lab as a founding partner, and describes its mission as the development of tools and training to “improve practices in the ethical sourcing, verification and reporting of stories that emerge online”. “The public will be encouraged to participate by submitting questions and links to disputed sites and social content for CrossCheck to investigate. These questions will all be listed and answered on a dedicated CrossCheck website,” says an explainer on the website. “CrossCheck brings together expertise from media and technology industries to ensure hoaxes, rumors and false claims are swiftly debunked, and misleading or confusing stories are accurately reported. With the French presidential election as its primary focus, journalists from organizations across France will work together to find and verify content circulating publicly online, whether it is photographs, videos, memes, comment threads or news sites,” it adds. There are currently seventeen media partners for Cross Check — including: AFP (Agence France-Presse), BuzzFeed News, France Médias Monde (via les Observateurs de France 24), France Télévisions, Global Voices, Libération, La Provence, Les Echos, La Voix du Nord, Le Monde, Nice-Matin, Ouest-France, Rue89 Bordeaux, Rue89Lyon, Rue89 Strasbourg, Storyful and StreetPress — who also helped design the vetting process. (Additional newsrooms and students wanting to join the project are asked to email crosscheck@firstdraftnews.com by February 10 for more information.) “Each participating newsroom will contribute their own experience, resources and regional knowledge to speed and strengthen the verification process, and to ensure that accurate reports reach citizens across the country and beyond,” the website adds. “CrossCheck partners, including a number of international news organizations, will ultimately make use of these reports in their own articles, programs and social media output.” Facebook’s contribution to the effort will include supporting the vetting platform through “dedicated tools and media literacy efforts that will help to explain the verification process and keep relevant audiences up to date with confirmed and disputed information relating to the election”. Specifically it will be providing CrossCheck partners with access to a tool called CrowdTangle to help with early discovery and monitoring of social content relevant to the election. It will also be helping to promote CrossCheck reports and resources on its platform to “relevant audiences”, through digital literacy campaigns “helping to explain the verification process and keeping the voting public up to date with confirmed and disputed information relating to the election”, according to a Google press release. Google Trends is another of the tools that will be used by partners in the effort — feeding in data about searches about candidates and campaign claims in real-time from across France. Other tools being deployed as part of the Cross Check initiative include: According to Les Echo Facebook has today also launched its own set of anti-fake news measures on its platform locally — letting users in France report content they believe to be fake. The company expanded its fake news fight to Germany last month, another country with elections due this year. In Germany it’s partnering with local checking organization Correctiv to help try to identify and flag dubious content being distributed on its platform. While in December the social media giant began flagging and down-ranking fake news on its platform in the U.S., following a storm of criticism regarding how it had allowed patently incorrect articles to be widely shared during the U.S. presidential elections last year. Le Figaro says Facebook’s media partners in France will vet any crowdreports flagged by local Facebook users, and if at least two of the partners agree content is questionable their verdict will be reflected by badging the content on Facebook with a pictogram. Badged content will also link to media partners’ verdicts on it. A recently published academic study suggests contextualizing disinformation with specific warnings can help defuse its potency to sway opinion online. Facebook users still wanting to share dubious content will be shown a warning about its disputed status. The visibility of questionable content will also be down-ranked in the Facebook News Feed. We’ve reached out to Facebook for confirmation of its anti-fake news efforts in France and will update this story with any response. Update: Facebook has said it will be working with the following organizations in France as its third party fact-checkers: AFP, BFMTV, L’Express, France Médias Monde, France Télévisions, Libération, Le Monde and 20 Minutes. Google News Lab and First Draft News previously worked together on a joint initiative in the US, called Electionland, aimed at surfacing and reporting evidence of voter suppression around the US election in November. In a statement about the new collaboration in France, Google News Lab’s lead in France, David Dieudonné, said: “It’s a natural next step to extend this uniquely effective and collaborative approach with newsrooms across France to cover one of Europe’s most-watched elections. We’re incredibly proud of this partnership and the new model of collaborative journalism it’s pioneering.” While Facebook has taken perhaps the most flak (fairly or unfairly) of any of the tech giants over how its platform has helped encourage the spread of fake news, Google has also faced major criticism for its AdSense ad placement program providing a financial incentive for third parties to create fake news in order to drive clicks and generate advertising revenue. And in November Mountain View made some policy changes to try to eject fake news purveyors from its ad placement network. Facebook also amended its equivalent (the Facebook Audience Network) at the same time. In an update at the end of last month Google noted it took down 1.7 billion ads that violated its AdSense policies — more than double the amount it removed the year before (albeit not all of these ejections pertain to fake news, but it’s clear the company is trying to step up efforts to clean up activity on the network). Both Facebook and Google are facing shareholder resolutions asking them to report on the impact of fake news on their respective business model and its wider impact on society. Last week Politico reported on the Facebook action, by Arjuna Capital and Baldwin Bros, two small investors in the social media platform. Arjuna also filed a similar resolution regarding the Google AdSense network back in December. Contacted by TechCrunch, Facebook declined to comment on the investor action. At the time of writing Google had not responded to a request for comment. This report was updated with additional comment from Facebook and details of the shareholder resolutions  \n",

            "377 Facebook’s AI unlocks the ability to search photos by what’s in them\n",
            "Initially used to improve the experience for visually impaired members of the Facebook community, the company’s Lumos computer vision platform is now powering image content search for all users. This means you can now search for images on Facebook with key words that describe the contents of a photo, rather than being limited by tags and captions. To accomplish the task, Facebook trained an ever-fashionable deep neural network on tens of millions of photos. Facebook’s fortunate in this respect because its platform is already host to billions of captioned images. The model essentially matches search descriptors to features pulled from photos with some degree of probability.  After matching terms to images, the model ranks its output using information from both the images and the original search. Facebook also added in weights to prioritize diversity in photo results so you don’t end up with 50 pics of the same thing with small changes in zoom and angle. In practice, all of this should produce more satisfying and relevant results. Eventually Facebook will apply this technology to its growing video corpus. This could be used both in the personal context of searching a friend’s video to find the exact moment she blew out the candles on her birthday cake, or in a commercial context. The later could help raise the ceiling on Facebook’s potential ad revenue from News Feed. Pulling content from photos and videos provides an original vector to improve targeting. Eventually it would be nice to see a fully integrated system where one could pull information, say searching a dress you really liked in a video, and relate it back to something on Marketplace or even connect you directly with an ad-partner to improve customer experiences while keeping revenue growth afloat. Basic structure of how object recognition works Along with today’s new image content search feature, Facebook is updating its original Automatic Alternative Text tool. When Facebook released the tool last April, visually impaired users could leverage existing text-to-speech tools to understand the contents of photos for the first time. The system could tell you that a photo involved a stage and lights, but it wasn’t very good at relating actions to objects. A Facebook team fixed that problem by painstakingly labeling 130,000 photos pulled from the platform. The company was able to train a computer vision model to identify actions happening in photos. Now you might now hear “people dancing on stage,” a much better, contextualized, description. Facebook isn’t the only one racing to apply recent computer vision advances to existing products. Pinterest’s visual search feature has been continuously improved to let users search images by the objects within them. This makes photos interactive and more importantly it makes them commercializable. Google on the other hand open sourced its own image captioning model last fall that can both identify objects and classify actions with accuracy over 90 percent. The open source activity around TensorFlow has helped the framework gain prominence and become very popular with machine learning developers. Facebook is focused on making machine learning easy for teams across the company to integrate into their projects.  This means improving the use of the company’s general purpose FBLearner Flow. “We’re currently running 1.2 million AI experiments per month on FBLearner Flow, which is six times greater than what we were running a year ago,” said Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, Facebook’s director of applied machine learning. Lumos was built on top of FBLearner Flow. It has already been used for over 200 visual models. Aside from image content search, engineers have used the tool for fighting spam.  \n",

            "Facebook’s  push for video goes well beyond the News Feed. On today’s earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg said 400 million people are making audio and video calls each month, up swiftly from 300 million in just September. That’s partly thanks to the December launch of multi-screen group video chat that looks similar to fast-rising startup Houseparty. Messenger is starting to become a VoIP giant like Facebook’s other chat app WhatsApp, which saw 100 million audio calls per day as of June. Zuckerberg also reiterated Facebook’s plans for video content. He noted that Facebook is now investing in partners producing longer-form professional videos. Meanwhile, in the effort to deliver high-speed internet to all of its users and everyone else in the world, Facebook says it’s connected 50 million people to the web, up from 40 million last quarter. Eventually, these efforts could pay off in terms of user growth and average revenue per user growth in the developing world. Video ads command the highest rates, and broadband access could help Facebook earn more from users in remote areas. Facebook’s video calling feature could put the squeeze on a wide array of competitors, including Google’s new Duo video chat app, Snapchat and Skype. Because Facebook is so ubiquitous, it can be more convenient than trying to set up a video chat with someone on other apps when you might not have their private phone number, email address or username. With Facebook, all you need is their name and you can talk face to face.  \n",

            "379 How Facebook plans to evaluate its quest for generalized artificial intelligence\n",
            "One of the biggest misconceptions about artificial intelligence is the belief that today’s AIs possess generalized intelligence. We are really good at leveraging large data sets to accomplish specific tasks, but fall flat at replicating the breadth of human intelligence. If we’re going to move toward generalized intelligence, Facebook  wants to make sure we know how to evaluate progress. In a paper, Facebook’s AI Research (FAIR) lab outlines just that as part of its CommAI framework.   First, the team argues that a proper generalized AI should be able to fluently communicate in natural language with humans. Researchers in the field of natural language processing have been working on the problem of human computer interaction through language for some time now, but we have a long way to go before our computational systems can rival humans. This is obvious if you’ve spent any time talking to the latest, greatest conversational AI systems on the market, like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. We will need our systems to be able to communicate and learn through language effectively, even when lacking context and discussing things in undefined terms. Moreover, such a system should be capable of learning new skills easily. Facebook calls this skill set “learning to learn.” Today’s machine learning models can be trained on data and used for classifying defined objects. We can use transfer learning to quickly adapt a model to accomplish the same task on new data, but our machines can’t teach themselves completely new skills without heavy intervention from developers. “It’s generally agreed that, in order to generalize across tasks, a program should be capable of compositional learning, that is, of storing and re-combining solutions to sub-problems across tasks,” the team adds. In a nod to the growing sub-field of reinforcement learning, Facebook also notes that a generalized AI should resemble a human’s ability to master new tasks with decreasing explicit rewards. And with respect to interface, modern systems should be able to take in new information and express themselves in a variety of ways that fit with the demands of diverse situations. Facebook considers these capabilities to be more of a prerequisite to generalized AI than a true Turing test. The original Turing test was created by Alan Turing in 1950. It’s generally understood to be a means of evaluating machine intelligence with respect to human intelligence. But as the field of AI has matured, the test has lost much of its relevance. Facebook provides a nice alternative way to think about the important requirements of a modern generalized AI that should be less of a research distraction than the more rigid Turing test. The FAIR team of Marco Baroni, Armand Joulin, Allan Jabri, Germán Kruszewski, Angeliki Lazaridou, Klemen Simonic and Tomas Mikolov also developed an open source platform for testing and training AI systems. Similar to OpenAI’s Gym, the CommAI-env tool focuses on more incremental tasks that build on previous accomplishments. It’s also designed to push models to their limits by emphasizing task variation.  \n",

            "Facebook  had another strong quarter in Q4 2016, earning $8.81 billion in revenue and $1.41 EPS. It pulled that from 1.86 billion monthly users, up 3.91 percent this quarter, or 70 million users, from 1.79 billion, but at a slower pace than its 4.67 percent growth last quarter. Mobile now makes up 84 percent of its ad revenue, the same as last quarter, accounting for $7.248 billion, signalling that Facebook has successfully completed its shift to mobile. Facebook blew past analyst estimates, which were  $8.51 billion in revenue $1.31 EPS. Profit reached $3.568 billion with revenue growth at 177 percent YoY, compared to $2.379 billion last quarter. Revenue was up 51 percent YoY compared to 56 percent last quarter and 59 percent in Q2. Facebook raked in $27.6 billion in total revenue in 2016. Last quarter Facebook warned that revenue growth would slow because it predicts it will run out of ad space in mid-2017, though it seems that’s already having an impact. But despite this slowing of revenue growth, investors pushed the share price up 2.52 percent in after-hours trading to $136.69 following the earnings announcement, after it closed up 2.23 percent at $133.23 earlier today. By the end of the earnings call, the after-hours share price has slipped to just 0.94 percent up. Daily active users hit 1.23 billion, up from 1.18 billion last quarter and up 18 percent YoY, compared to 17 percent last quarter. Facebook now has 1.74 billion mobile monthly users, up from 1.66 billion last quarter, and 1.149 billion mobile-only monthly users up from 1.055 billion last quarter. One of the most important and widely overlooked stats is Facebook’s stickiness, or what percentage of monthly users come back every day. That stayed constant at 66 percent, the same as last quarter. However, user growth in the U.S. and Canada is beginning to slow, where Facebook added just 2 million daily and monthly users this quarter to hit 180 million dailies and 231 million monthlies.  All of Facebook’s engagement and ad targeting is paying off. It reached a massive $19.81 average revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada, up 44 percent YoY. Globally, it hit $4.83 ARPU, up 29.5 percent YoY. That means it’s earning nearly $20 per user per year. The ability to squeeze more and more cash out of each user in its established Western markets, while steadily earning more in developing countries where it’s still growing, shows Facebook has strong earning potential for the forseeable future. During the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was repeatedly asked about Facebook’s video content strategy. He explained that “we’re focusing on shorter form content to start”, and that the company needs to build a sustainable ad revenue sharing business model to pay professional creators to bring that content to Facebook. Zuckerberg also noted video’s progress outside of content, citing that 400 million people use Facebook Messenger audio and video calling each month.  Facebook had a tumultuous quarter in the news after it was hit with allegations that fake news that spread through its network helped Donald Trump get elected. Meanwhile, it was just hit today with a $500 million penalty for damages related to Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey breaking an NDA with VR company ZeniMax. But in the meantime, Instagram has shined, and continues expanding its ad offerings. Its Snapchat Stories clone Instagram Stories hit 150 million daily users just 5 months after launch, and TechCrunch reported that an extensive set of sources believe Instagram Stories is stealing users from Snapchat. Now 13 years old, Facebook has shown remarkable stamina, keeping users happily sharing and Liking despite the shift to mobile and the advent of newer, more visual-focused social media platforms. As it expands deeper into chat with Messenger and WhatsApp, and virtual reality with Oculus, Facebook has a strong core business to rely on. And if it can use Instagram Stories and similar copycats in its other apps to ward off the threat of Snapchat, it could continue to dominate social media into the next decade.  \n",

            "381 Facebook’s new “Discover People” feature wants to help you make friends\n",
            "Facebook  is rolling out a new section on mobile called “Discover People,” which encourages users to introduce themselves by updating their profile, then scroll through a list of upcoming events to see who else may also be going, as well as browse through lists of people in their city or who share the same employer. The feature, designed to facilitate connections between people who aren’t already Facebook friends, could be used for business networking or even dating purposes, given its design. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that the feature is just starting to roll out to users on iOS and Android, but has not reached 100% of the user base at this time. “Discover People,” if available to you, is found in the navigation section below Friends, Events, Groups, Nearby Places, and other options. Facebook commonly adds and removes new features here as means of testing user engagement and interest. For example, this is where you’ll find more recent additions, like Offers, Find Wi-Fi, and Send or Receive Money, to name a few.  When you tap into the new section, the header at the top asks you to introduce yourself. This involves Facebook guiding your through your current profile to update its various sections. Here, you’re prompted to update your bio and add featured photos to your profile. However, you’re not able to customize an introduction that’s meant to be seen only by those in the “Discover People” section. Below this, is a list of upcoming events where you’ve registered your interest, have been invited, or plan to attend. These are designated as “People going to…” followed by the name of the event. When you tap into one of these events, instead of being shown the event details, you’re presented with the profiles of the people going, which you swipe through one-by-one. You can also scroll through your past events further down.  And, at the very bottom of the screen, there are ways to browse through people living in your town or through a list of people who work at your company. None of the sections will show you the profiles of those you’ve already friended on Facebook, as the feature is designed to facilitate making new connections. Facebook says only public information is shown on the profiles that display here. There’s a bit of a stalker-ish feel to some of this, given that you’re swiping through the profiles of strangers, in many cases, as many Facebook events are open to the public. However, the feature would work well for business networking purposes. Or, perhaps, even dating, as it would allow someone to find your profile then tap to message you. The icebreaker, of course, is already available – you’re both going to the same event, after all. That being said, not everyone will feel comfortable with their profile being used in this way. It’s already troubling to some that marking yourself as “interested” in a public event is also public post. For a network that has rolled out so many granular privacy settings over the years, not allowing people to control who can see this information is something of an oversight – and a potentially dangerous one for those who may have real-life (not just virtual) stalkers, like women who have fled domestic violence situations. The new feature is also interesting because is shows that Facebook is thinking about how it can better connect nearby people who share the same interests. The company is often thinking of new ways to bring people together. Years ago it launched “Friends Nearby,” but finally backed away from exact location sharing this December, due to users’ privacy concerns. It also now has a massively popular Groups feature. Along with Events, these can help foster new friendships. While not explicitly stepping into the realm of dating with “Discover People,” Facebook is likely concerned about the growing number of dating apps inching into its territory. Apps like Tinder and Bumble have begun to develop features that help people find new friends to hang out with, not just people to date, via things like Bumble BFF and Tinder Social. And when any other social app steps onto Facebook’s scene, the social networking giant soon tries to figure out how to compete. “Discover People” launched in New Zealand and Australia at year-end, as a limited test. There are some examples of people who spotted this section in the fall, for instance. Facebook says now that the feature is making its way to all users on mobile. “Too often, it’s hard to learn more about people around you, whether it is upon starting a new job, joining a new group, deciding if you want to attend an event, or moving to a new place,” a spokesperson explains. “To make it easier, we’re starting to roll out a new bookmark in the More menu called ‘Discover People’ that can help you discover more about people you have things in common with by browsing through profile cards of people in your community.” Updated, 12:20 PM ET with Facebook comments.  \n",

            "382 Facebook said to plan set-top box app as a new venue for its video content\n",
            "Facebook  is working on a video-focused app aimed at set-top boxes including Apple TV (and different entirely from its existing offering on Roku, which is essentially a variation on its current mobile app), according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. The plans focus on helping turn Facebook’s wellspring of video content into a destination on a platform that’s almost exclusively aimed at delivering video, in a bid to help it better tap into budgets that are currently going towards traditional TV advertising. The report also reiterates claims we’ve seen before that Facebook is looking to license quality original video content, similar to how Netflix and Amazon will often pick up the exclusive rights to shows for distribution on their own platforms. That would be a big draw for a dedicated video app, and help bring in audiences that might not necessarily join in if all that was available was user-generated content. Premium content means more premium ad dollars, too, which according to this report does seem to be the goal for Facebook with this endeavor. It also sounds like there would be opportunity here for Facebook to use this as a means to further its ambitions as a live video source, since users could broadcast to the TV app. Twitter uses its own Apple TV app as an endpoint for its live programming experiments in partnership with media companies and sports leagues, so this could indeed prove fruitful in helping it expand that part of its video strategy, too. Of course, this would also make Facebook look even more like a media company than it already does, which would put renewed energy into the debate around its responsibilities there and general role in disseminating information. But YouTube is already well on its way to being a broad replacement for traditional cable and satellite video delivery, so it would make sense for Facebook to press on with its own efforts to stake out some of that territory, and a dedicated app for set-top boxes including Apple TV and Android TV devices would be a relatively low-cost way to do that. We reached out to Facebook, but they had not responded as of publication time.  \n",

            "Following a chaotic, divisive first week, President Trump is set to announce his pick for the Supreme Court tonight. Not one for tradition, the White House will broadcast the nomination on Facebook Live, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern. The choice to announce during a primetime TV time slot is unusual, but not entirely surprising given Trump’s personal and professional interest in television ratings. By moving up the news, which was expected later this week, and attracting a more mainstream, less wonky viewership, the Trump administration likely seeks to divert attention away from the heated national conversation prompted by last week’s contentious immigration order. Join @POTUS Trump tonight at 8pm EST as he announces his #SCOTUS pick! We'll be streaming the historic event LIVE: https://t.co/eyVqKv25A3 pic.twitter.com/ffobmBxK1b — The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 31, 2017  I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.) — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017  While the nominee remains a mystery, CNN reports that frontrunners Neil Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman have both been brought to Washington ahead of the live event. Making use of social video platforms isn’t a White House first by any means, but courting a wide audience on a platform like Facebook Live to create drama around a Supreme Court nominee feels decidedly more like a reality show than watching the State of the Union on YouTube. Unfortunately for the White House, the process of getting that nominee confirmed won’t make for very good viewing.  \n",

            "384 Facebook changes feed to promote posts that aren’t fake, sensational, or spam\n",
            "Facebook  is prioritizing “authentic” content in News Feed with a ranking algorithm change that detects and promotes content “that people consider genuine, and not misleading, sensational, or spammy.” It’s also giving a boost to stories that are going viral in real-time right now that could help it compete with Twitter for in-the-moment news sharing To build the update, Facebook categorized Pages that frequently share inauthentic posts like fake news and clickbaity headlines, or get their posts hidden often. It then used these posts to train an algorithm that detects similar content as its shared in the News Feed. Facebook will now give extra feed visibility to posts that don’t show signs of similarity to inauthentic content. Meanwhile, Facebook wants to more quickly surface big stories going viral either because the topic is being posted about by lots of people, or a Page post about the topic is seeing tons of engagement. Facebook will then take that as a signal that you might temporarily care more about the topic, and therefore show it in your News Feed while it’s still hot. Facebook says it doesn’t anticipate significant changes to most Pages’ News Feed distribution, but some might see a small increase or decrease in referral traffic or outbound clicks depending on if they share authentic, timely content vs inauthentic and outdated stories. This is the latest push in Facebook’s ongoing quest to remove fake news from the News Feed. Last month it announced a slew of feature updates including partnerships with third-party fact checkers to add warning labels to fake news stories. Its reputation was marred by allegations that fake news in its feed helped get Donald Trump elected. Facebook risks people turning away from the News Feed or being hesistant to click stories they see if it can’t get a handle on fake news. Since the News Feed is both the primary driver of Facebook’s mission to connect people, and the source of much of its ad revenue, battling misinformation is critical to its public perception, even if the company says fake news makes up only a tiny fraction of what’s shared.

            "385 Facebook launches a marketing mix modeling portal for comparing Facebook ads to TV, print & more\n",
            "Facebook  today announced a laundry list of updates regarding its measurement partnership program, including expanded partnerships with Nielsen and comScore, and the addition of a new partner, DoubleVerify. The company also offered details on the status of current integrations, and the launch of a new online portal to help marketers see how their Facebook ads perform, in comparison with other platforms, like TV or print. The company, in the past, has been taken to task for not offering clear metrics, and, at the end of last year, Facebook announced a series of metrics bugs and errors that led to inaccurate reporting of critical data. By working with third-parties like Nielsen and comScore, which become Facebook partners last spring, the goal has been to ensure that advertisers are able to trust their ad delivery data. Those partners have been integrating with Facebook in order to measure things like the impression, reach, performance and other metrics advertisers care about. Today, Facebook says that Nielsen’s Digital Ad Ratings product can now be used to measure reach and in-target performance on desktop and mobile in 8 more markets, which means it now supports 25 markets worldwide. Meanwhile, comScore, which has already been working with Facebook on viewability verification of video impression, is now beginning to test in-target reach for U.S. audiences on desktop and mobile via its validated Campaign Essentials product, the company says. Facebook explains that this metric is more important to advertisers, because it’s what media plans are built around, and is used to evaluate the campaign’s success. Several partners, including comScore, Integral Ad Science and Moat, can also now provide metrics on when display ads enter and appear on the Facebook screen, thanks to finalized integrations that were first announced this November. (There’s still some debate about this metric, however, as it’s not the same as the industry standard – 50% of pixels in view for one second for display, or 2 continuous seconds for video, AdExchanger points out). And Facebook says it has extended its viewability measurement to more placements across Facebook. Initially, this was available only for video on Facebook, but has since been expanded to include Instagram video, and now, comScore and Integral Ad Science can measure video as well. DoubleVerify is coming on board, too, to support both video and display. When its integrations are finalized, Facebook will have a total of 24 global third-party measurement partners available to advertisers.  Perhaps most notably, Facebook also launched a Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) portal online, where measurement partners can gather data directly from Facebook, Instagram and the Audience Network for their clients. Here, they’ll be able to compare which ads – including TV, digital and print – are best helping them reach their desired outcomes. Over 150 brands are already using this information to make their marketing decisions, Facebook said.    \n",

            "One year ago Facebook made the surprising announcement that it was shuttering Parse, the development platform that it purchased in 2013. While the company said they would keep the service online for a year so developers could migrate their apps to a new backend, that time has finally come. In what is probably the last ever post on the Parse blog, the service reminded users that today (January 30th, 2017) they would be disabling the Parse  API on an app-by-app basis. Parse was best known for its “backend as a service” product, and provided SDKs and APIs to let developers quickly get apps up and running without the effort of building a backend from scratch. At one point there were 600,000 apps that relied on the platform. While Parse wasn’t the most popular tool amongst experienced developers (who had the resources to build their own custom backends), it was an invaluable tool for smaller developers. I first came across the service in high school when I was just dipping my toes into iOS development. The low cost (free for most small users) combined with relative ease of use and detailed documentation made it an invaluable tool for me and many other young developers. That’s why the community was so shocked when Facebook decided to shut it down — supporting Parse seemed like a small price to pay to appease an entire developer community, many of whom Facebook relies on to build apps for Facebook. Parse did publish a big migration guide, as well as open source their server backend, both of which are legitimate alternatives for developers needing a Parse replacement. Bye Parse, we hardly knew ya.  \n",

            "Getting locked out of your account sucks. Almost everyone has experienced the frustration of forgetting a password, losing the phone on which they receive two-factor authentication codes, or jumbling the answer to a security question. But as exasperating as it is to lose access to your account, none of the widely-available measures for account recovery are very secure. Major breaches like the recently-disclosed Yahoo hacks often include not only passwords but also answers to security questions, which hackers can recycle across other sites to compromise your accounts. Many sites will respond to a lost password report by sending a recovery link to the user’s email, which could itself be compromised. Facebook  wants to fix the process of account recovery — and replace email as the hub of online identity management in the process. Facebook security engineer Brad Hill announced today at the USENIX Enigma conference that his company is launching an account recovery feature for other websites called Delegated Recovery. Facebook will let users set up encrypted recovery tokens for sites like Github, and if a user ever loses access to her Github account, she will send the stored token from her Facebook profile back to Github, proving her identity and unlocking her account. Encryption of the token provides privacy — Facebook can’t read the information stored in the token, and it won’t share information about your identity with third-party websites. “No matter what kind of site you are, you have to deal with the issue that someone will lose their password or their token,” Hill told TechCrunch, pointing out some of the flaws with SMS two-factor authentication and password reset emails. “We can get you back into your account even if you drop your phone off the boat.” Delegated Recovery isn’t just a security feature — it’s a way for Facebook to convince users to center their online identity around their Facebook profile, rather than their email address. Account recovery has typically revolved around the email you use to register for all your online accounts, where you’ll receive a password reset email if you get locked out. “There’s a lot of technical reasons why recovery emails aren’t that secure. Email security doesn’t have the greatest reputation right now. It’s the single point of failure for everything you do online,” Hill explained. By moving account recovery to an encrypted token system on Facebook, the company can offer improved security and elbow email out of its way in the process. Facebook’s account recovery feature will be available in a limited trial with Github, starting tomorrow. The feature will be part of Facebook’s bug bounty program, allowing security researchers to test it and point out vulnerabilities. The tool is being released as open-source, allowing other websites to implement it. “We’re building this and giving it away because recovery is a problem every online service shares. Recovery isn’t a product, it’s a foundation. Secure access is the foundation on which we build all our other products,” Hill told the Enigma audience.  \n",

            "After an era of cowed silence, noted fair-weather feminist and Facebook demigod Sheryl Sandberg finally spoke up! Sandberg had not objected to the Trump administration — clearly an affront to her values, the values that have sold more than two million copies of Lean In — but late this week she posted on her platform of choice to decry Trump’s day one expanded global gag rule. That law will yank foreign aid from any nongovernmental organization that so much as discusses abortion as an option with patients. And yes, for anyone with even a passing interest in women’s health, that policy is bad. Sandberg is right about that part! So, um, about that Women’s March. Sandberg’s only other recent Facebook posts concern a feel-good story about a long-distance swimmer (hashtagged #LeanIn) and a politically defanged feel-good story about a Syrian refugee Olympian, the latter on the eve of the inauguration. On January 21, the day of the unequivocally historic Women’s March, Sandberg didn’t appear in public, nor did she express her support. Instead, she withdrew comfortably into the same “deafening post-November silence” that for many women in tech isn’t going unnoticed. The streets filled with women from every walk of life, but for Sandberg, who built her personal brand — and some of her fortune — around a particularly virulent strain of apolitical white feminism, it appears to have been all too political. (Sheryl, if you read this, pick up some bell hooks!) Still, she makes time for closed-door meetings with Trump, just like the rest of Silicon Valley’s groveling elite. Image via Getty/Business Insider At the World Economic Forum in Davos just days before the inauguration of an administration openly hostile to women, Sandberg mustered up only a few hilariously anemic insights about gender disparity, none rooted in the very real events unfolding around her, insulated as she may be by fame and wealth. As Fortune reports: Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg  on Wednesday narrowed her fight for gender equality to a single enemy: gender stereotypes in advertising. “I don’t think it’s possible to overstate how important stereotypes are,” she said at a panel in Davos, Switzerland, where the annual World Economic Forum is being held this week. The problem is “at the root of the gender gap we face,” she said. Thursday, she explained her opposition to the global gag rule in a Facebook post, stepping very carefully among perceived political landmines:  \n",

You know what’s less controversial than taking a strong stand against domestic policy? Taking one for all those women in other countries who will be affected by a policy that, while deeply bad, is hardly exceptional situated in the context of the Trump administration. Though it does jibe well with her personal brand of do-gooder imperialism, not unique among Silicon Valley types. One week into the Trump administration, it appears to be her only objection (if it isn’t, please get in touch!). Given its long straightforwardly partisan track record, Sandberg’s statement against the global gag rule is far less controversial than denouncing any number of other truly very alarming things happening under Trump because her criticism is aimed at Pence and the GOP establishment. Facebook doesn’t really need anything from them. As Vox explains: The global gag rule has become something of a political seesaw since Ronald Reagan first implemented it in 1984 at a United Nations population conference in Mexico City (which is why it’s also called the “Mexico City policy”). Bill Clinton repealed it immediately when he took office. George W. Bush immediately reinstated it when he took office. Then Barack Obama immediately repealed. Indeed, Pence is the one hung up on abortion — Trump’s just along for the ride. Sandberg’s business dealings and tax repatriation skittishness concern Trump, not his far more ideological vice president. It’s true that this is more of that liberal infighting you keep hearing about. But the truth of the matter is that as a feminist, it’s perfectly acceptable to hold other feminists to certain standards. Particularly ones in positions of vast power that at times find themselves seated next to arguably the most powerful man in the country (hint: it’s Pence!). And ones that have sold millions of books promoting a diluted form of feminism that might have got us here in the first place. Oh, and ones making a fortune off of a sandbox for fake news stories, or as Sandberg playfully likes to call them, “hoaxes.” Sandberg’s is not an intersectional feminism, nor is it really feminism at all. Like much Silicon Valley hypocrisy, it’s lip service that never quite takes it to the next level. Leveraging your particular strain of politically expedient pseudo-feminism to sell books is fine and all, but don’t expect us not to call you out — not when you have a literal seat at the most powerful table in the world.  \n",

            "Following Bloomberg’s report, the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society (what a name) officially announced that Apple is joining other tech companies as a founding member of the AI initiative. Companies will work on research projects, AI best practices and more. The Partnership on AI was officially unveiled back in September 2016. At the time, Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft were the only founding members. Apple, Twitter, Intel and Baidu didn’t participate in the initiative. But Apple  was already enthusiastic about the project, so today’s news is more about formalizing the company’s involvement. Siri co-founder and CTO Tom Gruber is going to represent Apple. You can find the full board of trustees on the partnership’s website. In other news, six independent individuals are also joining the board based on their past achievements when it comes to AI. Dario Amodei (OpenAI), Subbarao Kambhampati (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence & ASU), Deirdre Mulligan (UC Berkeley), Carol Rose (American Civil Liberties Union), Eric Sears (MacArthur Foundation) and Jason Furman (Peterson Institute of International Economics) will participate in the discussions. While the Partnership on AI has yet to clarify its areas of work, you can expect to see research papers on AI. The companies could write about ethics, inclusivity and privacy as these are hot topics. The first meeting is taking place on February 3rd. Artificial intelligence is great, but it needs some ethical supervision in order to benefit everyone. The Partnership on AI could also be a great lobbying tool, proving that tech companies are acting responsibly. It’s a good way to win everyone’s trust. Finally, Apple couldn’t miss out on this opportunity if it wants to hire some of the best AI engineers. Apple shows that it has a seat at the AI table. That’s why engineers working for the company also published a research paper. Now that it’s getting more competitive to hire the best AI talent, these signs are becoming increasingly relevant.  \n",

            "MailChimp has long offered its users an easy way to manage and run their email marketing campaigns. Now, for the first time in its long history, the company is going beyond email marketing with the launch of a new tool that lets its users create Facebook ad campaigns right from the existing MailChimp dashboard. The company may be best known for its email platform, but as a company spokesperson noted, its mission goes way beyond that. MailChimp  wants to become a holistic marketing platform for businesses (and I would expect that at some point in this process, it’ll change its name to reflect that). As mobile, social, and messaging become more important, that means MailChimp needs to go where its users’ target audience is — and the one place these users definitely are is on Facebook. As MailChimp notes, 16 percent of its more than 15 million users are e-commerce companies — a number that has increased 46 percent over the last year. Almost half of MailChimp’s current revenue also comes from exactly these customers. Given that many of these companies are probably already using both MailChimp and Facebook Ads, there are some clear synergies here.  If you’ve ever designed an email newsletter in MailChimp, then the process of building Facebook Ads and campaigns should feel pretty familiar. Unsurprisingly, MailChimp will let its customers use their email lists to target their existing fans and customers, but it will also allow them to target a Facebook “lookalike audience” that has characteristics that are similar to existing MailChimp subscriber lists, as well as simply targeting a specific audience on Facebook. MailChimp will not charge its users any fees on top of Facebook’s usual costs (which start at $5 per day for the click-based ads) and will allow them to track their campaigns right inside of their existing MailChimp dashboards.  \n",

            "392 Facebook will give some longer videos a boost in the News Feed\n",
            "Facebook today is changing how it ranks the videos that appear in the News Feed, with the goal of better surfacing those that are more relevant to you. It’s a slight tweak, but one that could boost the visibility of longer videos, in some cases. It can be more of commitment to watch a longer video in full, of course – the content has to be interesting enough to keep your attention. Now, long videos that people are actually watching may be distributed more on Facebook. The company explains that “percent completion” – how much of a video is watched – is still just one of the signals it uses to determine which videos should show up in your News Feed. It also takes into account a number of other factors, like if you turn on the sound, go fullscreen, turn on high-def, among other things. And it considers whether or not a video is live. However, the percent completion signal needed an adjustment, Facebook found. After all, it’s a lot easier to watch a shorter video all the way through, compared with a long one. That’s why it makes sense to weight this percent completion signal a bit more, the longer the video is. However, this change won’t only impact those videos that get watched to the end. It will also affect longer videos that people are watching in general, even if they’re not completing them. For example, before, if people were watching 75 percent of a 2 minute video, that was ranked the same as watching 75 percent of a 10 minute video. Obviously, that’s not really fair. Now, the algorithm will put more weight on completing that longer video. This includes Facebook Live videos that were recorded earlier, and have now transitioned to regular videos. In addition, the algorithm will apply not just to those videos on the News Feed itself, but also in the Suggested Videos section which appears below the one you’re currently viewing. For Facebook Page owners, the takeaway here is that longer videos that engage users may get a bump up in terms of distribution, but the side effect could mean that some shorter videos see a small dip, Facebook confirms. There’s no set length on what makes a video “long,” however. As Facebook explains in its announcement, “the best length for a video is whatever length is required to tell a compelling story that engages people, which is likely to vary depending on the story you’re telling.” Facebook also recommends that Page owners utilize the video insights section in their Page Analytics in order to understand what works best for their particular audience. The change is not immediate, but is rather rolling out gradually over the next few weeks.  \n",

            "393 Facebook brings its Slideshow movie-maker to Android\n",
            "This past summer, Facebook  introduced a new photo-sharing sharing tool called Slideshow that’s able to turn your photos and videos into mini-movies that also include themed music and transitions. The feature had originated in Facebook’s private photo-sharing app Moments before making its way over to the main social network. The idea is to offer Facebook users an easier way to create more compelling, engaging posts as an alternative to simply posting a video or a bunch of static photos. The Slideshow movie-maker had also arrived at a time when many tech companies, Apple and Google included, are trying to figure out new ways to help users do more with their now numerous photos and videos, while also helping to automate sharing. Apple last year announced its mini-movie maker called Memories in iOS 10, for example, and Google Photos has long since included several automated photo tools, including its own movie maker. At launch, Facebook’s version would prompt users who were posting their status to create a Slideshow if they had snapped more than five photos or videos in the last 24 hours. A “Try It” button also appeared next to friends’ slideshows you were viewing. Now, however, you’ll see the option appear when you click on the Status bar (“What’s on your mind?”) alongside the others, like Photo/Video, Go Live, Check In, Feeling/Activity, etc. This is where it will be found on Android  as well.  Image credit: Android Police Slideshow’s Android launch was first spotted by the blog Android Police, which noted that the option is appearing in this same section, just above the “Tag Friends” option. Not everyone is yet seeing this feature, though. Facebook confirmed to us that it has just started to test the feature on Android, and only a small percentage of users are seeing it appear for the time being. It’s interesting that it’s still being characterized as a “test,” given that the feature has been live on iOS for over half a year. But since it’s not a full rollout yet, it’s possible that Facebook will make some tweaks ahead of its public launch. The movie maker basically works the same on Android as on iOS for now. You’re prompted to select from a gallery of your own photos and videos, and then set your title and pick your music before publishing to Facebook. (Facebook provides the music choices as before – you can’t choose your own.) Facebook didn’t say when Slideshows would roll out to all Android users, but given the feature’s maturity, that date is not likely to be too far away.  \n",

            "394 Facebook rolls out safer logins with a security key\n",
            "No one wants to hand over their account to a hacker. Today, Facebook  is adding a new feature that will help protect users from getting their accounts compromised. Facebook users can now use a security key to authenticate their identity during the login process. If you use a security key, hackers won’t be able to get into your Facebook account, even if they have your username and password. Security keys are a form of two-factor authentication — an optional extra layer of security that helps you prove your identity when you log in. During a typical two-factor authentication process, the user enters their username and password, then the site they’re logging in to responds by texting them verification code. The user enters the verification code, proving that he or she is the proper user of the account, and not a hacker logging in with a stolen password. But this method has its downfalls. A determined attacker can reset the SIM for the user’s phone and intercept the SMS messages, as we saw in the targeted hack of the activist DeRay Mckesson last summer. Security keys solve this problem by cutting out the need to transmit the verification code to the user. Keys like those manufactured by Yubico fit into a USB port and can generate a one-time code at the tap of a finger — and, unlike SMS, these codes can’t be captured without physical access to the security key itself. In addition to being more secure, security keys make the login process with two-factor authentication feel a bit faster and more seamless because you don’t have to sit around waiting for the text message to be delivered. Conveniently, security keys still work even when text messages don’t, so you don’t lose access to your accounts just because you don’t have cell service. If you already use a security key to log into your accounts on Google or Dropbox, you don’t need a new one. You can use the same key across all your accounts. Brad Hill, a security engineer at Facebook, says it was easy for the company to roll out the feature because it was already used in-house by the engineering staff for logging in to internal systems. It was simply a matter of extending the feature to Facebook’s users. “We don’t consider two-factor a mandatory thing,” Hill explains. “We see account security as our responsibility regardless of technologies you choose to use. For people who want to stay in control, this would be a good choice for someone who wants to stay ahead of even the most advanced attacks.” Unfortunately, there’s not a great way to integrate security keys with most mobile devices yet. When logging into their Facebook accounts on mobile, most users will still have to go through the regular old two-factor SMS process (Facebook also lets users generate their verification code through the Facebook app). Users with NFC-capable Android devices and the latest versions of Chrome and Google Authenticator can use an NFC-capable key to verify their identity on the Facebook mobile website. The challenge of using a security key with a mobile device is one Hill expects to see addressed in the future. Although access is currently limited to certain Android users, Hill says he anticipates more APIs on the Android platform that will support security keys — and that other platforms will follow suit. Ready to activate your security key? Go to Security Settings in your account and click “Add Key.” (Note: This will only work if you’re using the Chrome or Opera browser.)   \n",

            "Hugo Barra,  who previously held a positions as a key VP for Android at Google, and led Xiaomi’s international efforts in a VP role at the Chinese company, is now joining Facebook . Barra announced his departure from Xiaomi on January 22, after a three-and-a-half year stint at the company. Barra will lead all of Facebook’s VR efforts, including Oculus, according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who shared the news on his FB profile.  I'm excited that Hugo Barra is joining Facebook to lead all of our virtual reality efforts, including our Oculus  team…. Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday, January 25, 2017 Barra fills a gap left behind when Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down from the top stop at the Facebook-owned virtual reality company, moving instead into a role leading Oculus’ PC-focused VR efforts. In his announcement of the news, Zuckerberg noted that he’s known Barra since the ex-Android exec helped develop the world-leading mobile OS, and that Barra believes, along with Zuckberberg himself, that VR and AR are going to be the next big computing platform after mobile. Facebook will spend over $3 billion over the next decade to help spread VR to the masses, Zuckerberg revealed in testimony in an ongoing lawsuit against Oculus by ZeniMax, the former employer of Oculus CTO John Carmack. Barra helped Xiaomi introduce its own Mi VR headset, and speaking to Bloomberg last year, he had plenty of praise for Google’s Daydream VR platform. He also talked about it as a tech that will likely come to fruition more in 2017, which makes it apt that he’s joining Facebook this year to help that company further its VR efforts. Joining Facebook as VP of virtual reality (VPVR!) to lead Team @Oculus. So excited! Mark posted about it here: https://t.co/kYgIniSQiM pic.twitter.com/7fYTkniykr — Hugo Barra (@hbarra) January 26, 2017  When he posted about his departure from Xiaomi, Barra noted that he was going to be headed back to Silicon Valley, and it looks like he’ll be very close to his old stomping grounds indeed. Barra himself added that he “can’t wait to get started” in the new role: “It’s been a dream of mine to work in virtual reality even back when AR/VR were just figments of science fiction; now we’re taking selfies in virtual worlds :) I learned from Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun that there’s no greater calling in our industry than taking breakthrough tech and making it available to the greatest number of people,” he said. Ibe himself even got in on the comments. “I’m thrilled to join forces and look forward to learning from you Hugo. The best team in the world just got even better!” he said.  \n",

            "396 Facebook Messenger begins testing ads…and they’re big\n",
            "Facebook today is beginning to test integrating ads into its mobile messaging app’s user interface. The company says it will launch what it characterizes as a “very small test” in Australia and Thailand, which will allow businesses to place an ad on the Messenger  home screen. These fairly prominent card-style ads include image thumbnails accompanied by text and a link. They appear below your recent conversations, says Facebook. The link in question can direct users to take different actions, like clicking to learn more about the business or signing up for a service, among other things. This is similar to how Facebook Pages for businesses today can direct users to take a specific action, like shopping their site, or starting a chat, for example. The ads currently take up a lot of screen space on the homescreen, where they sit below your Favorites and above the Active Now section, which shows you which friends are online. This seems to make Messenger less user-friendly, as you have to scroll past these large, hard-to-ignore ads, just to use other key Messenger features. Facebook at least promises that ads will not appear in conversations, unless the user chooses to click on the ad or start a chat with the brand. “Businesses have long been telling us that they are very excited about the potential of the Messenger platform to reach their customers and help them to drive sales, build brand awareness and increase customer satisfaction,” writes Facebook Product Manager Eddie Zhang, in an announcement detailing the new ads. Sure, businesses are excited. Users, however, less so.  At present, Facebook already provides other ways for businesses to reach customers via Messenger, including News Feed ads that take users into a chat session and sponsored messages. Messenger today has over a billion monthly users which could be reached through advertisements like this. The company also notes that people are sending over 1 billion messages to brands per month – a stat it highlights as if it’s some indication that people will want to see ads like this in Messenger. But the truth is, people like to reach out to businesses via Messenger because it’s a more efficient ways of asking questions or getting customer service compared with calling the business or shooting an email. That doesn’t mean that they want the user interface of one of their main messaging apps cluttered with advertisements. Of course, this is still just a test for now. If interaction between these ads and Messenger users is low, Facebook may rethink how the implementation will be handled. In addition, the company notes that users can hide and report specific ads using the dropdown menu in their Messenger. It’s long been rumored that Facebook would further monetize Messenger via ads, though previous leaks had pointed to plans that would allow businesses to start chats containing ads with users who had initiated chat threads with the business before. This later turned into sponsored messages. But those type of ads are more interruptive, and could make people less likely to open organic messages, because they come to think of messages in the app as being spam. The new ads, on the other hand, seem to more closely resemble the banners in News Feed that you scroll past. Facebook says the ads will roll out to a test group of people in Thailand and Australia in the coming weeks.  \n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            " Together, these updates will make it much easier for Facebook to bring Trending to more countries and languages, as it’s only available in a few places that speak English plus India right now. The unified set of Trends with headlines attached could also help surface news publishers to new audiences, simultaneously helping Facebook’s news partners grow while decreasing the filter bubble phenomenon that causes people to only see points of view they agree with. Facebook VP of Product Management Will Cathcart tells me “One of the nice things about Trending is it helps you know what’s going on across Facebook whether or not it matches up with what your friends are talking about or publishers you follow are talking about.” Instead of relying on its own humans to write descriptions, which could be biased or just take a ton of labor, it’s piggybacking on professional publishers who’ve already written clear descriptions of the news. It could do this with any local publishers. Facebook’s algorithms will pick the most engaging publisher’s post about the topic that has a headline that fits in the allotted space, and humans will only serve to check that a Trend relates to a real-world happening and doesn’t violate its community standards before it goes live. By removing the personalization, Facebook also eliminates confusion about why something was Trending for one user and not another. This could also create a sense a community around Trending, since users will know that other people in their country will have seen the same Trends if they were on Facebook and can discuss them together. And with the new measurement system, Facebook could avoid accidentally making fake news shared by a popular public figure into a Trend. Facebook will also be scanning for reports of a story being fake and disqualify those to prevent misinformation from seeping into Trending.  Facebook first launched Trending in 2014 in what was seen as a copy of Twitter, but with the added benefit of human-written descriptions so you actually knew why a hashtag, brand, celebrity, or phrase was popular. But in 2016, Gizmodo published allegations that Facebook’s human curators for Trending had biased the feature to suppress politically conservative topics. Though Facebook reported its investigation found no evidence of purposeful or widespread bias, it decided to lay off the human description writers and institute a more algorithmic approach to picking what appeared in Trending in a way that gave more weight to stories popular with smaller publishers, some of which are more conservative than the top outlets. While absolving Facebook from some criticism of human error, it made the product prone to mistakes where fake news stories appeared as Trends, such as one that said Fox News had fired Megyn Kelly. It also made it tougher to know what a Trend was about without hovering over it to see a news story about it. Now Facebook is adding context back in by including news publisher headlines.  \n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            " Lovers of niche news topics will now be met with a more generic set of Trends, though they can go through the Trending feature’s tabs to see stories about particular topics like Politics or Entertainment. The new unified set of Trends for each country makes Facebook a bit more like Imgur or the old Digg, where users can commune around a particularly popular topic. “There are some tradeoffs” Cathcart admits. “If I’m not into sports I might see Trends about sports.” But he insists having a wider perspective about what’s on the country’s mind, even if it’s not on yours, is valuable. “It’s useful to know that that’s one of the topics on Facebook that people are talking about” he concludes. It’s a stern shift from Facebook’s typical reliance on personalization across its product. And in some respects, it makes Facebook more like a media company, since it’s showing the same content to everyone, even if algorithms are heavily involved in the curation. But Mark Zuckerberg says he sees Facebook as a town square, and now everyone in town will see the same Facebook newspaper headlines.  \n",

            "Instagram put a dent in Snapchat by placing its own version of Snapchat Stories atop its feed, and now Facebook  is doing the same. Today Facebook launched Facebook Stories in Ireland on iOS and Android, with plans to bring it to more countries in the coming months. The feature lets you share ephemeral photos and videos in a slideshow that disappears 24 hours later. The little circles to watch friends’ Facebook Stories appear in its main app above the feed so you can’t miss them. Here’s a demo video showing how Facebook Stories works: Why another attempt at copying Snapchat when Facebook already has a selfie mask-filled camera feature, Instagram Stories, and Messenger’s new camera too? The company tells TechCrunch: “Facebook has long been the place to share with friends and family, but the way that people share is changing in significant ways.  The way people share today is different to five or even two years ago — it’s much more visual, with more photos and videos than ever before. We want to make it fast and fun for people to share creative and expressive photos and videos with whoever they want, whenever they want.”  While Facebook has tried to push other copycats of Snapchat, they’ve typically lived in separate apps like Poke and Slingshot, or as features buried behind the News Feed, like its revamped camera. But now it will be impossible to use Facebook without being exposed to Facebook Stories. And if there’s a space to show off in front of friends, people will use it. One question will be how Facebook handles Stories on desktop. While most users rely on mobile to connect to the social network, it might be strange if they can’t watch Stories on their computer. The fact that Instagram Stories soared to 150 million daily users in just 5 months using this exact same format hints that Facebook Stories could prove popular too. Facebook built a similar feature to Stories called Quick Updates and tested it in July, but by August said it wouldn’t launch it. Apparently Instagram Stories’ success changed its mind, and that might cause trouble for Snapchat’s upcoming IPO.  Even if it can hold on to its North American user base, Facebook’s invasion of the space could prevent Snapchat from growing further, especially internationally. If you can get similar functionality in a convenient place without having to rebuild a friend graph, some people will be happy to settle for a clone.  \n",

The short version of how things would go down: It’s a relatively simple bug — but, with a codebase as big and complicated as Facebook’s,  it’s exactly the kind of bug that can go unnoticed for ages, and the kind of bug that bounty programs can help unearth before too much damage is done.

            "400 Facebook is looking at ways to mitigate the impact of fake news\n",
            "Fake news has been top of mind for a lot of people as of late. After the presidential election in the U.S. and public outcry over the prevalence of false information on Facebook,  the company announced measures to prevent fake news from appearing on the platform. But there are still concerns about the civic consequences of fake news and the effect it has on people once it’s already been spread. Now, Facebook is trying to figure out what to do once the misinformation is already out and how to curtail its impact, Facebook VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri said last night on a panel, “Separating fact from fantasy: Is fake news undermining the truth?,” at the University of California Berkeley. One approach, Mosseri said, could be to let people know retroactively. So, if someone read and/or shared a story that ended up being fake, Facebook could notify them. “You want to make sure as little comes in the system as possible and when it happens, you need to react as quickly as you can,” Mosseri said. “And if you didn’t find it until later then you need to consider letting people know. The question is who and how. I don’t know if we’ll do that but it’s certainly something we’re considering.” The term “fake news” is being used to describe anything from errors to deliberate falsehoods, UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism Dean Edward Wasserman said on the panel. Whether it’s intentional manipulation or a journalist who accidentally gets something wrong in a news story, it can fall under the umbrella of fake news. Last month, Mosseri revealed the company’s plans to battle fake news that gets shared and spread throughout the platform. Earlier this week, Facebook expanded those measures to Germany. But Mosseri noted last night that fake news was a thing on Facebook before the election, and something Facebook had been working to address for a couple of years. The main difference has been the public outcry in the wake of the election, Mosseri said. “In terms of how much we’ve seen, we actually haven’t seen a ton of increase around the election,” Mosseri said. “The amount of fake news on the platform, actually — and I’m not trying to diminish the importance of the issue — is relatively small. It’s a very small percentage of what people see. It should be smaller. It should get as close to zero as possible.” Something all the panelists agreed on last night is that there will always be fake news, especially as long as there is a financial incentive. Although Facebook doesn’t make money from fake news, Mosseri said, the platform does send economic value to fake news publishers. “We need to do what we can to reduce the distribution that fake news publishers get as close as we can to zero,” Mosseri said. “That’s kind of what we started to do in December and we have more work to do.” Ultimately, the aim is to prevent fake news from entering Facebook in the first place, Mosseri said. That’s why “disrupting the economic model is so important,” he said. One area Mosseri is particularly excited about is taking a closer look at landing pages. If you look at a landing page and 90% of the page are ads, Mosseri said, that’s a sign that it’s not a legitimate site. “We’ve done some work but I think we have a lot more work to do,” Mosseri said.  \n",

            "401 Russia-backed RT unblocked on Facebook, claims Dataminr also revoked access\n",
            "Russian state-funded media company RT  (previously Russia Today) was temporarily banned from posting content to Facebook — a move that would have prevented the organization form posting articles, photos or video to the social network until Saturday, the day after Trump’s inauguration. However, Facebook says now that it has lifted the ban, and will look into the reasons behind the block. “All the features for this page owner have now been restored. We are looking into the reasons behind the temporary block,” a Facebook spokesperson said. Separately, RT claimed that it had been blocked by Dataminr, which provides analytics on top of the firehose of Tweets on Twitter to parse and alert its customers about when things happen. It’s used by media and other organizations to track Tweets for news and other large events. The Facebook ban would have allowed RT to post text updates to Facebook, but not other media content. According to a post on RT’s website, the ban would have lasted until Saturday, 2:55 PM EST. The reason for the block is being attributed to an illegal live-stream of President Obama’s final press conference Wednesday. But RT denies this, saying they were running an AP stream of the event instead.  There are some conflicting allegations swirling around this story. According to RT’s editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, the Facebook block followed a complaint sent to Facebook by Current Time TV, another media property that describes itself as a joint project of Radio Liberty and Voice of America, which are both backed by the U.S. government. But RT also reported that Current Time TV, when asked, told the news organization they did not send in any complaints regarding either RT or any other news outlets. The post from RT also suggested direct U.S. government involvement was at hand. Simonyan was quoted as saying: “I’m not surprised. If the Department of State could block oxygen to us, they would do it.” But sources familiar with the matter at Facebook said that a link to outside factors and events is not accurate. Delighted to be back on Facebook, thanks everybody for your support https://t.co/sJTadoXQMk pic.twitter.com/y98xFJx8a2 — RT (@RT_com) January 19, 2017  We understand also that Facebook’s community operations team is now in the process of reviewing the reasons behind this block. RT has a sizable Facebook presence, with 4.1 million likes. However, the organization’s vocal support for president-elect Donald Trump led some to think the timing of the ban was suspicious,  especially given the recent news from U.S. intelligence agencies that pointed to Russia’s involvement in trying to influence the U.S. elections. But the timing of the ban is odd for another reason. RT claims that Dataminr, a Twitter news discovery tool, has also denied RT service. However, when asked, Dataminr’s founder and CEO, Ted Bailey, declined to comment, neither on RT nor on whether the allegation of a block is accurate. Dataminr, which counts Twitter as one of its investors, gets the full “firehose” of Twitter’s public data — that is all Tweets that are not sent as direct messages — and provides analytical tools news alerts on top of that to track events as they unfold. Dataminr does not provide predictive analytics but the analytics can help anticipate what that might happen next.

            "402 Facebook agreed to pay a lot more for Oculus than we realized; here’s why\n",
            "Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a Dallas court yesterday as part of a lawsuit claiming that Oculus VR, the startup Facebook acquired for roughly $2 billion, was based on stolen technology. Unsurprisingly, Zuckerberg defended Oculus  and in the process revealed a number of new details about the negotiations involved in purchasing the company. Among them: that Facebook agreed to pay $700 million in employee retention bonuses for “key people.” It was news to the rest of us. When Facebook announced the deal back in 2014, it said it was paying a “total of approximately” $2 billion, including $400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook. It said the agreement “also provides for an additional $300 million earn-out in cash and stock” based on Oculus meeting certain milestones. It said bupkis about that extra $700 million in retention bonuses. Was its own release “fake news?” It’s known that the actual price paid for a company and what the public sees in headlines is rarely the same, owing to factors like the fluctuating value of an acquirer’s stock. But a $700 million difference? Isn’t that notable? Actually, no, said some bankers, lawyers and analysts with whom we spoke yesterday. Here’s why. That original press release from Facebook addressed the price paid for Oculus to its former owners (including its founders, Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, and Spark Capital, among others). That’s the $2 billion, plus that $300 million earn-out component. Meanwhile, the $700 million that Zuckerberg referenced yesterday takes into account the ongoing costs following the close of the deal. Those costs — in the form of performance incentives — aren’t typically considered in the purchase price as they’re paid out over time, says Lori Smith, co-chair of the corporate and securities group at White and Williams in New York. “I don’t know the terms of the employment agreements” in this case, Smith says. But such employee incentives are “not typically considered [in the] purchase price, as [they are] paid over time for services to be provided to the buyer by those employees.” In short, the new employees have to work for that money. Tom Peters, cofounder of the San Francisco-based investment bank Inverness Advisors, largely agrees with Smith. As a former managing director at Montgomery & Co.,  Peters worked on the sale of MySpace to News Corp. in 2005, and says that while the deal is referred to this day as costing $580 million, it was really $630 million by the time every i was dotted and t was crossed. “The devil is always in the details,” he says. When it comes to this particular disparity, while it may seem “shockingly big,” he says the money that was set aside for compensation to certain Oculus employees for continuing to work at Facebook must have been separated out from purchase price, which is a “not uncommon” practice, he says. “It’s often viewed as in a different category, including because of accounting guidelines that tell you to account for things in different ways.” (He notes, for example, that tax treatments and tax consequences differ when it comes to purchase prices versus compensation.) In the end, “it was a judgement call,” says a San Francisco-based investment banker who asked not to be named. “Certainly, Facebook could have mentioned the possibility of additional payments at the time of the acquisition. Then again, does it want to be known for paying big retention bonuses and earn-outs? You can see the case [for leaving out that information].” “There’s no good reason for Facebook to lie,” adds Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research. “It certainly earned the right to do things like [acquire Oculus].” The simplest explanation for not disclosing that $700 million in retention bonuses sooner, he says, is “the scenario they wanted to present to investors is that in the worst case, we’ve thrown away $2 billion.” Either way, it remains fascinating how much Facebook was willing to pay for Oculus, which has now provided between a 35x to 150x return to its shareholders depending on how long they’ve held on to their Facebook shares. So says March Capital Partners’ Jamie Montgomery, whose previous bank invested in the company. Oculus might prove worth it, too. Its technology clearly won’t benefit Facebook as quickly as Facebook had once hoped, however. As Zuckerberg reportedly testified yesterday, “I don’t think that good virtual reality is fully there yet. It’s going to take five or 10 more years of development before we get to where we all want to go.”  \n",

            "403 Facebook replaces its old inbox with the web version of Messenger\n",
            "Just under two years ago, Facebook  introduced a web interface for its private chat application, Messenger. Now, Facebook is integrating that same web app into the desktop version of Facebook, where it replaces the older messaging experience. The change has been spotted by a number of users in multiple markets – including TechCrunch staff in the U.S. and Europe – which hinted it was more than a small-scale “test.” Facebook did not make a formal announcement about the change. However, in the comments of a post by Facebook head David Marcus, he’s responding to a lot of feedback about the new upgrade to Messenger within Facebook, and summarized Facebook’s response in this comment. Some users, of course, are demanding the old Inbox be returned. (After all, it seems like every Facebook change must be rebelled against at launch.)    If you’ve been upgraded to the new Messenger interface on Facebook.com, you’ll notice a few subtle changes to the user interface, when accessed from the desktop. For starters, the previous inbox icon has been replaced with the Messenger icon in the blue navigation bar at the top of the screen. When clicked, you’re taken to a revamped inbox that looks like what you’d see if you had visited Messenger.com directly. Here, the left side of the screen reads “Messenger” above the list of those friends you had recently chatted with, while the center of the now three-paned interface will display the content of the currently selected chat session.  The right-hand side of the screen introduces something new, too, as it displays the name of your friend in the selected chat, when they were recently active, and provides access to other Messenger features. This includes the ability to search the conversation, edit nicknames, change the chat’s color, change emoji, and mute notifications. There’s also a link to the person’s Facebook profile, for easy access, and below that, are the photos you and the friend have shared in Messenger. Meanwhile, at the top-right of the screen, there are buttons to initiate a call, video call, as well as an “i” icon in a rounded blue button that will hide the right-hand informational panel from the screen.  Other Messenger options are tucked away under the Settings icon on the top-left, including access to your “Message Requests” (the replacement for that hard-to-find “Other” inbox), Archived threads, a list of Active Contacts, and more.  Facebook has long approached Messenger with a different strategy on mobile, than it has on the web. On mobile devices, it pushed users away from the web version of Messenger and to the dedicated mobile app. But on the desktop, the web version of Messenger was designed as a complementary counterpart to Facebook’s top-ranking mobile Messenger application. It offered a way to keep up with your friends without being distracted by Facebook’s News Feed and other notifications. (Facebook has even dabbled with building a native Mac app for Messenger.) The change to Facebook.com’s messaging experience comes on the same day that Facebook’s David Marcus made a series of announcements about what we can expect from Messenger over the course of 2017. The service, which now has over a billion users, has seen a number of updates in recent months, the post noted, including the addition of visual and expressive features to rival Snapchat, like masks, effects and stickers, as well as the addition of Group Video Chat, Games, a platform for businesses, and more. As for what’s next, Marcus was light on specifics, but noted that the company planned to launch a directory of bots and would help developers build on top of the Messenger platform using technologies like A.I. Overall, the post implies Facebook wants to make Messenger thought of as more than a chat app, but a social network of its own.  \n",

            "404 Facebook plans to invest more than $3 billion in VR over the next decade\n",
            "Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees virtual reality as a future computing platform that his company has a chance to own, though he admits it may take 5 – 10 years to bring it to the masses. Members of the press had a rare opportunity to get a more unfiltered view into the future of Facebook’s virtual reality ambitions as Zuckerberg took to the stands today to testify in a $2 billion lawsuit surrounding the origins of Oculus, a VR company it acquired in March of 2014. At the heart of its case is the claim that Oculus acquired information from former ZeniMax employee and current Oculus CTO John Carmack that was instrumental to the creation of the the company’s core technology, help that ZeniMax was never compensated for. Zuckerberg told the courtroom that the company will likely invest more than $3 billion over the next decade to bring VR to hundreds of millions of users, the NYTimes reports. Zuckerberg has already invested heavily in its VR play. Zuckerberg testified that prior to its acquisition, then-Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe was asking for $4 billion for the VR company. Facebook and Oculus eventually settled on a $2 billion purchase price along with $700 million in employee retention and $300 million in milestones. These figures all show the dedication that Zuckerberg has to Facebook furthering its grasp on the virtual reality industry, something it likely hopes to spend billions innovating on not paying legal damages for.  \n",

            "405 Facebook to open Startup Garage at Station F in Paris\n",
            "Station F is better known as the world’s biggest startup campus. Based in Paris, the huge historical monument is going to have 3,000 desks for tech companies of all kinds. This morning, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg came to Paris to announce that Facebook  is going to be one of Station F’s launch partners. Here are all the details. “We talked a lot with this ecosystem and a lot of companies decided to help us,” French billionaire Xavier Niel said. “Facebook was the first that wanted to be part of this good idea.” Niel founded telecom company Free and has a bunch of startup-related projects as well, such as Kima Ventures, an early stage investment company, and the free coding school 42. He’s financing Station F with his own money, with Roxanne Varza leading the project. “We’re thrilled to be a founding partner and start the Facebook Startup Garage here,” Sandberg said. “My guess is that we’re going to learn even more from working with you than you working with us.” Starting in April, Facebook will have 80 desks on a mezzanine near the entrance. The Facebook logo is already there, waiting for the building’s grand opening. Every six months, Facebook will work with 10 to 15 startups and help them as much as they can. There will be Facebook engineers and weekly workshops so that young startups can learn from Facebook. And I’m sure Facebook will spot potential acquisitions quite early with this program. Some of the first startups are Chekk, Mapstr, The Fabulous, Onecub and Karos. With 32 million monthly active users on Facebook in France, Facebook could attract quite a few startups. “Later we’ll launch our first policy lab at Sciences Po working with Ecole 42 and SupInternet,” Sandberg said. This project is unrelated to Station F. Thirty students will meet with Facebook every week to make the world a better place (or that’s how I think about it). “Proof of our dynamism is our international ranking,” said Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who was also attending the launch. “The city of Paris has become London’s main challenger when it comes to investments in startups.” It’s clear that Brexit has made Paris even more attractive than it used to be. Facebook is just one of the many partners that are going to work with Station F. Varza unveiled some of the launch partners at TechCrunch Disrupt London in December. TechShop will open their first shop outside of the U.S. if you want to learn woodworking or CNC machines. Vente-privée will open a startup program and the incubator of HEC Paris will move there. French VC firms, such as Daphni, Ventech and Kima Ventures are going to have an office there. And anyone will be able to rent some office space for €195/desk/month in the huge 366,000ft² (34,000m²) building. Station F is shaping up nicely — and while Facebook’s commitment isn’t exactly groundbreaking, catching the attention of such leading tech companies is a good sign.  \n",

            "406 An NFL player went on Facebook Live from the locker room and nothing good happened\n",
            "Yesterday after the Steelers upset the Chiefs in an AFC playoff game, Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown decided to go on Facebook Live from the locker room to celebrate with his fans. And the fans loved it – he went live for 17 minutes and had almost 900,000 views within just a few hours, before the video was deleted. A player using technology to celebrate directly with his fans in real-time. Great, right? Not so much. A few things. First, the NFL’s social media policy prohibits players from using any form of social media starting 90 minutes before the game starts, up until after the post-game press conference end. While no fine has been announced yet, ESPN’s Adam Schefter noted the a league official said Brown “could be fined” for the video stream. Secondly, the NFL’s broadcast partners are contractually the only ones allowed to shoot video in the locker room after a game – teams and even the league itself can’t even use that footage until 24 hours after the game ends. And while this incident probably isn’t big enough for NBC (who broadcasted the game) to complain to the NFL, it’s definitely a sign of potential issues in the future as livestreaming becomes a more important part of our social media culture. And lastly, NFL locker rooms are traditionally pretty off-limits when it comes to the press and access to the outside world. Football is a competitive sport, and confidential plays, speeches and interactions give teams the advantage they need to win. So you could imagine how upset the Steelers were when they found out that the Facebook  Live broadcast captured audio of Head Coach Mike Tomlin’s post game speech happening in the background. Tomlin’s very NSFW speech (which you can find on YouTube) was basically a minute long rant against the Patriots (and their Microsoft Surface hating coach Bill Belichick), who the Steelers will play next week. While I’m sure stuff like this is being said in all 32 locker rooms across the league, it’s still a bad look for Tomlin and the team. Oh, and of course Belichick was asked what he thought of the incident, since his team was the one getting trash talked. And in typical fashion his response was about as un-technologically savvy as it gets – saying that he’s “not on SnapFace”, and not worried about what they put on InstantChat”.  \n",

            "407 Facebook takes its fake news fight to Germany\n",
            "Facebook  is expanding its trial of measures to combat fake news beyond the U.S. for the first time — and will shortly be rolling out the updates in Germany. In a blog post yesterday the company said it will be introducing the updates to the market “in the coming weeks”. Last month Facebook’s VP of News Feed, Adam Mosseri, detailed the company’s plans for fighting fake news being shared and amplified on the platform. This followed a storm of criticism about Facebook’s role in the US presidential election, with many commentators pointing the finger of blame at the social media giant for not doing enough to stop the spread of bogus information via its News Feed. Not least because, according to a 2016 Pew study, a majority of US adults get news via social media. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg also finally conceded the company has “a greater responsibility than just building technology that information flows through”, rowing back from his previously stated position that Facebook is a technology company, not a media firm. “While we don’t write the news stories you read and share, we also recognize we’re more than just a distributor of news,” he wrote in a status update on December 15. “We’re a new kind of platform for public discourse — and that means we have a new kind of responsibility to enable people to have the most meaningful conversations, and to build a space where people can be informed.” Measures Facebook has been testing in the U.S. to fight fake news — and which will soon be arriving in Germany — focus on three areas: Why is Germany being prioritized? The country is due to hold elections this year, which likely explains why it’s next in line to get the Facebook updates. Fascinating to see Kremlin trolls starting up the Merkel operation in real time today. Mostly repurposed pro-Trump accounts. pic.twitter.com/mlqQxFmf1k — Angela Merkel (@Queen_Europe) December 20, 2016  In recent years the German government has also been critical of Facebook’s response to another problem: the spread of hate speech via its platform. In Germany the fact checking organization Facebook is working with to tackle fake news is Correctiv — which does not (yet) appear to be a signatory of Poynter’s code. Facebook says its external fact checkers in Germany are “signing the Poynter guidelines”. We’ve reached out to Correctiv with questions and will update this post with any response. Update: A spokesman for Correctiv confirmed it is in the process of joining Poynter’s, noting: “This takes some time due to technical circumstances (they remodeled their website).” Asked how it will be determining which stories to flag, he said: “We are in the first phase of this project and still do not know, how to handle this issues. But I’m sure, we will soon have answers.” In terms of which local publishers Correctiv trusts, he named Spiegel, Süddeztsche Zeitung and FAZ as three examples. Facebook says posts identified as fraudulent by Correctiv will be badged with a warning label that identifies them as untrustworthy, although badged posts will still include a link to the suspect article, along with a justification for it being flagged as fake. The company further notes that messages classified as untrustworthy may also appear later in the newsfeed. And while it will still be possible for users to share posts labeled as untrustworthy it will not be possible to share the original content without the ‘suspect content’ warning. “We will learn from these tests in Germany and will further improve and expand our tools over time,” says Facebook in a blog post on the launch (translated from Germany via Google Translate). “It is important to us that posts and news posted on Facebook are reliable. We are pleased with this progress, but we know there is still a lot to be done. We continue to work on this challenge and will introduce these innovations in other countries in the near future,” it adds. After Facebook announced its plan to lean heavily on the expertise of third party fact checkers to help police the veracity of News Feed content — and specifically on those who have signed up to Poynter’s principles — the latter organization is overhauling its vetting process for signatories. It notes on its website that it won’t be adding any new signatories until it has these new procedures in place. “We conducted an interim desk review of the U.S. fact-checkers and will ask all signatories to produce a full report within the next few weeks. While the pilot phase of Facebook’s program unrolls, aspiring new signatories can express their interest through our online form but will not be vetted before a definitive vetting system has been established,” Poynter’s further adds in a Q&A about its role in Facebook’s trial.  \n",

            "408 What Facebook’s European payment license could mean for banks\n",
            "Early in December, Facebook finally unveiled their newly acquired licenses for e-money and payment services out of Ireland. The rumors of Facebook entering the payment space in Europe have been going on ever since it was reported that Facebook applied for a money transfer license a while ago. Another clear indication of Facebook’s ambitions in payments was the hiring of former PayPal president David Marcus as head of Facebook Messenger. As Mark Zuckerberg stated in January last year, “We’ll partner with everyone who does payments.” With Facebook Payments already operative in the U.S., an obvious play is to launch this service across Europe, as well, and the jury is out as to whether Facebook will be satisfied to provide a simple P2P payment service to create stickiness to their Messenger platform or whether they’re targeting the $500+ billion global remittance market, as well. If we look beyond payments as an isolated service, Facebook as a licensed payment service company is representing several scenarios to which banks should pay close attention. The coming payment service directive 2 (PSD2) is requiring that banks must offer payment APIs to third-party providers of financial services and allow users to mandate licensed third parties to 1) initiate payments and 2) extract account information. Facebook has already disrupted the classifieds market with the launch of Facebook Marketplace, and with PSD2, Facebook has the possibility of becoming their own payments processor as a PISP (Payment Initiation Service Provider) and connecting to bank accounts directly through APIs. Facebook may then ask consumers for permission to use their bank details as a payment method. Once you give permission, Facebook will be able to securely access your bank account and collect their payment. In addition to cost savings, a solution where Facebook takes on the role as a PISP eliminates the need for complex check-out processes and provides “one click”-payment options for recurring customers. By collecting payments directly from customers’ bank accounts, PSD2 will also enable faster payments, as well as blur the lines between traditional industries. Facebook also may become an AISP (Account Information Service Provider). The directive enables AISPs to present an aggregated view from more than one bank account. AISPs can analyze spending behavior or aggregate into one overview a user’s account information from several banks, rendering obsolete traditional mobile and online banking solutions based on one account. It is already obvious that chatbots will have a significant impact on banking, as a majority of banking services could be automated through simple chat requests like “what is my daily spending limit until my next paycheck” or “approve and pay my outstanding bills.” Why bother to log into your bank app when everything is already available and secure directly in Facebook Messenger? As a licensed payment services company, Facebook also has the necessary regulations in place to provide settlement risk to be compliant as a crowdlending platform (in some countries). Even though this is a crowded space, with almost 300 alternative finance and crowdfunding platforms across Europe, Facebook has a unique position in this space with its vast user base and ability to utilize user data, as well as account information for assessment of risk and creditworthiness. Facebook is already in a unique position to disintermediate retail banks as the most powerful digital ecosystem out there for consumers. The key to Facebook’s powerful position is the ability to evolve alongside changing user behavior; so far, Facebook is excelling at this. What makes Facebook one of the most potent digital ecosystems is that it is based on managing the digital identity of every user in its user base, and, if done right, Facebook has the potential to render phone numbers, email addresses and bank account numbers obsolete. Eventually this could make banks as we know them invisible commodity providers, where all customer interaction — payments, e-commerce and everyday banking — is conducted through digital ecosystems like Facebook Payments and Facebook Messenger. According to a study conducted by pwc, 68 percent of bankers are concerned with losing control over their customer interface. A regulatory compliant Facebook should definitely make those concerns turn into worries.  \n",

            "409 Facebook is censoring posts in Thailand that the government has deemed unsuitable\n",
            "For millions of people, Facebook  is the internet — but many of those who rely on the social network for news and views may not be aware that Facebook isn’t immune to internet censorship itself. That’s become apparent in Thailand, where Facebook is blocking content from a number of users following an apparent request from the government. Thailand’s lèse-majesté law prevents criticism of the country’s royal family, and it looks like it is being used to suppress postings from a number of high-profile users who are writing about the transition to a new king, including journalist Andrew MacGregor Marshall. The former Reuters correspondent, now a lecturer at Edinburgh Napier University, is already well known to Thai authorities. His 2014 book on the Thai royal family was banned and branded a “danger to national security and peaceful and orderly society.” TechCrunch has independently confirmed that, as MacGregor Marshall noted, at least one of his posts is not available in Thailand but can be read outside of the country. Marshall McGregor’s profile and the rest of his feed remain visible in Thailand. The post in question is from late December and, while it isn’t clear when it was blocked, a reposting made this week was visible in Thailand at the time of writing. Facebook declined to comment for this story. This isn’t the first instance of the social network upholding local law in Thailand. Its own data shows that the firm restricted access to 10 pieces of content in the country in the first half of 2016. Facebook’s latest privacy report for the second half of last year is due to be released soon. In its 2016 report, Freedom House, a U.S. think tank that monitors global freedoms, noted that Thailand’s internet and media are “not free.” Thailand’s junta government took power in a 2015 coup — which included a half hour blockage of Facebook — and it has continued to suppress criticism online. “Internet freedom declined in 2016 as the military leadership continued its efforts to codify censorship and surveillance powers through legislation,” Freedom House wrote. The situation has intensified as new King Maha Vajiralongkorn has ascended to the throne following the death of his father, the much revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in October. Just last month, Thai authorities paid a visit to the BBC’s offices in capital city Bangkok in response to the news organization’s reporting of the newly appointed monarch. Facebook has failed to deal with the issue of fake news recently, particularly around the U.S. election, while a number of high-profile censorship incidents, including the blocking of an iconic photograph of a girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam War, have highlighted its struggle to realize its responsibilities and influence as a media company. In this case, however, complying with Thailand’s lèse-majesté is very much deliberate. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is driven by a vision of “connecting the world” and, though he has said a compromise is necessary in the case of countries like China where free speech is restricted, it is hard to see how that vision fits with kowtowing to a law that has gotten Thai people jailed for Facebook comments, or even merely receiving a message on the social network. Facebook is the largest platform, but it is far from the only target for Thai censors. The government has previously taken action against content on YouTube, the Daily Mail, and chat app Line, among many other online platforms. Ministers have even gone so far as to claim that they can monitor conversations on Line, which has over 20 million users in Thailand. Japan-based Line, which is listed on the NYSE, rejected the claim as untrue.  \n",

            "410 Facebook previews journalism features like digests and subscription trials\n",
            "Between fake news and publishers struggling to keep a loyal connection to their readers, Facebook’s  relationship with the journalism business is a bit strained right now. So today Facebook is revealing its roadmap of upcoming news features that it calls “The Facebook Journalism Project” to make its commitment to the industry clear. These future launches include digest packages of Instant Articles to which users can subscribe, free trials for paid subscriptions, hackathons with publishers’ development teams, additional Facebook tutorials for journalists, PSAs to promote news literacy and combat misunderstanding of fake news and more work to prevent hoaxes from spreading. Facebook is also now giving away access to CrowdTangle, the journalism tool startup it acquired that helps reporters sift through trends, measure their social posts and identify sources and influencers. Plus, for the first time, journalists who post from their standard user profile will be able to see basic analytics on the videos they share, like a stripped-down version of the Insights tool offered to Facebook Pages.  This initiative could assist publishers with fostering lasting relationships with readers outside of Facebook and avoid getting lost in the feed. Meanwhile, it could help them build new products and open access to tools that aid their teams, while educating the public on how to be good news readers. “We’ve really heard it loud and clear that [publishers] want a deeper lever of collaboration, not just in partnerships but in product and engineering,” Facebook’s director of product Fidji Simo tells me. Most importantly, the Facebook Journalism Project could help prevent publishers from being commoditized such that all that matters is the content people consume on Facebook, not who wrote it. When Facebook launched Instant Articles in May 2015, it heralded a way for publishers to beat slow loading times on mobile where users were increasingly reading news. Instead of waiting up to 10 seconds for an outside website to load, Facebook would host the stories inside its own app in a standardized, “readable” format that would load… instantly. On a per-unit economic basis, this looked like a big win for publishers. More users wanted to click their stories, and fewer bounced before they loaded. Even if Facebook restricted what could be shown and how many ads could appear in the Instant Articles causing publishers to earn less per view, they were getting enough views to make up for it. Instant Articles, on the left, previously offered less style customization and business opportunities than a publisher’s traditional website But the hidden, second-order effect was that publishers had their identities sterilized. Instead of people reading on their websites with their custom branding, unique visual style and heavy promotion of their other stories, the Facebook-hosted Instant Articles from different outlets looked largely identical. This deteriorates the connection between publisher and reader, threatening to turn content creators into merely interchangeable ghostwriters. Over time, it could lead people to just haphazardly read whatever was in their News Feed, rather than seeking out certain publishers, visiting their homepages directly, paying for their subscriptions and attending their events. That’s why two of the new features bolded below from the full list should be the most exciting for the journalism industry: While Facebook is staying vague on the exact designs of some of these changes because it’s still hammering out the best way to build them, these two have big potential. Facebook’s new head of news, former TV anchor Campbell Brown Packages of Instant Articles will allow users to click through a cover story on the News Feed and then choose between several of the outlet’s stories, potentially based around a theme or as a digest of the day’s biggest news. Users can subscribe to be notified when these digests are released. This “packages” feature is currently being tested with The Washington Post, Fox News, El Pais and the Hindustan Times. Another feature will let Instant Articles publishers include a box where users can sign up for a free trial of their paid subscription. Facebook is testing this with German news organization BILD. If Facebook provides more ways to create and fund high-quality journalism, its News Feed will remain informative and entertaining despite the difficulties with earning money as a publisher in the modern age. Facebook just hired Campbell Brown as its head of news. Now instead of just promising its publisher partners that Facebook cares about journalism, she’ll have a roadmap of upcoming features to prove it.  \n",

            "411 Europe proposes expanding telco data privacy rules to WhatsApp, Facebook et al\n",
            "The European Commission  has set out proposals for updating rules which govern the use of personal telecoms data that would expand their remit to cover email and mobile messaging data for the first time — meaning the ePrivacy regulation would also apply to web companies such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Apple and Google. Telcos have long complained about regulatory asymmetry vis-a-vis use of personal data, with tougher privacy rules applying to data sent using their services vs data sent via comms apps and services operated by Internet companies. All electronics comms providers would be covered under the new proposal — to, as the EC puts it, “reflect the market reality” — although telcos are still not happy, with ETNO and the GSMA putting out a statement arguing the proposal new ePrivacy rules still impose stricter requirements on them when it comes to processing certain types of data vs other comms players. “Rules applying to the processing of location data in connected cars, IoT devices or mobile apps illustrate the issues at stake, as we risk to jeopardise 5G business models,” they argue, calling instead for a “trust-based use of the data collected by telecom operators”. The new rules would allow telcos to make use of comms content and/or metadata to provide “additional services” — such as, in one example provided by the EC, producing heat maps that indicate the presence of individuals to help public authorities and transport companies when developing new infrastructure projects. Although user consent must be obtained for processing data for such purposes — hence the telcos’ complaints they will be unable to complete on a level playing field with other providers already offer additional services, such as digital mapping. Cookie rules are also set to change under the new proposal — in a bid to streamline what the EC dubs “an overload of consent requests for internet users”; itself the result of a 2009 update to the ePrivacy Directive. The EC claims the new rules will give users more control over cookie settings, providing “an easy way to accept or refuse the tracking of cookies and other identifiers in case of privacy risks”. Although it remains to be seen whether they will impact the flotilla of cookie consent notifications that accompany Europeans around the web. Advertising industry groups aren’t happy with the proposed changes, with the IAB claiming the new law would “undeniably damage the advertising business model”, while still — it argues — putting a heavy burden on web users when it comes to cookie setting admin. “Without significant improvements to the proposed text, users would have to actively change the settings of every single device and app they use, and more actively deal with constant requests for permission for the use of harmless cookies when visiting websites and using other digital services,” the IAB claims. Despite ad industry complaints, some use-cases for what the EC dubs “non-privacy intrusive cookies” will no longer require consent under the proposals, such as cookies used to remember shopping cart history, or set by a visited website counting the number of visitors to that website. Although that suggests there may be confusion ahead for services to determine when/whether they need to obtain consent for their cookie or not. Another ad group, the EACA, has also complained the ePrivacy proposals take “a restrictive approach towards third party data-driven business services providers” — warning they “may provoke the further accumulation of data by a few large global companies, while inadvertently excluding other businesses from the competition”. Other aims for the new regulation are to harmonize the rules with the EU’s updated General Data Protection Direction (GDPR), which was overhauled last year — and is due to come into force in the EU in 2018. This means the stricter fines for data protection violations set out in the GDPR (of up to four per cent of a company’s global revenue) will also apply for companies breaching the EU’s ePrivacy rules. Not included in the proposal: an earlier suggestion to have browsers default to not allow cookies; a strict privacy by design framework; and an earlier plan to allow EU citizens to bring class action lawsuits for privacy infringements… Not good that final #ePrivacy text scrapped group action possibility for consumers ≠ not in line with GDPR. Was in earlier draft pic.twitter.com/rejSVuiR2G — The Consumer Voice (@beuc) January 10, 2017  The Commission ran a public consultation on changing the ePrivacy directive last year, taking feedback from various consumer and industry groups — though not, in the event, following the vast majority opinion of EU citizens (81.2 per cent), nor of public authorities (63 per cent), who supported imposing obligations on manufacturers of terminal equipment to market products with privacy-by-default settings activated (vs 58.3 per cent of industry favoring the option to support “self/co-regulation”). EU presents overhaul of #ePrivacy rules. Missing: Privacy by default rules pic.twitter.com/1jy0im0FoY — The Consumer Voice (@beuc) January 10, 2017  The EC had originally hoped to have new ePrivacy rules proposed by the end of 2016, but that’s been pushed into the start of the new year. The new proposals will now need to be debated and accepted by the European Parliament and EU Member States before they become regional law — so it’s likely there will be amendments (and much fierce lobbying) along the way. The EC is aiming for the regulation to be adoption by May 25, 2018 — when the GDPR is due to come into force.  \n",

            "412 Apple, Facebook and Google top Greenpeace’s clean energy report\n",
            "Apple has earned the title of greenest tech company in the world for the third year in a row, according to a new report from environmental organization Greenpeace . In a new report, “Clicking Clean: Who is Winning the Race to Build a Green Internet,” Apple lead the pack with an “A” grade and a clean energy index score of 83 percent. Facebook and Google also did well, with scores of 67 and 56 percent, respectively, along with data center provider Switch, which scored 100 percent. However, Netflix, Amazon Web Services and Samsung were found to be lagging. Greenpeace’s clean energy index accounts for how much clean energy the companies use from renewable resources, as well as other factors, such as their willingness to make their energy consumption publicly available, and their commitment to powering their data centers with renewable energy, for example. Because of these companies’ size, they have the power to influence others in the industry when it comes to the use of clean energy. As the report noted, Apple plays a “catalytic role within its IT supply chain, pushing other IT data centers and cloud operators who help deliver pieces of Apple’s corner of the internet to follow their lead in powering their operations with renewable energy.”  Facebook also received accolades for being the first major internet company to commit to be 100 percent renewably powered, and it continues to play a leadership role in the sector. Its five latest data centers were renewably powered, Greenpeace pointed out.   Google, too, has been taking steps toward a renewably powered Google Cloud, and is improving its deployment of renewable energy in new markets, but was dinged for being less transparent than others, including Apple, Facebook and Switch, in terms of providing facility level energy demand data. The report called out major tech companies Netflix, Amazon, Samsung, and others. It also for the first time analyzed Asian tech giants, like Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and Naver, which are expanding to become global businesses. That region is “well behind the U.S. market in renewable commitments,” said Greenpeace, citing fewer clean energy options from monopoly utilities. This is of particular concern for environmental organization, given these companies’ ongoing growth and expansion. “We must see East Asian internet companies exhibiting the will to commit to 100 percent renewable energy, particularly as they expand to markets around the world,” said Greenpeace East Asia Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner Jude Lee, in a statement.  “Leading IT companies in the United States have already shown that the majority of the industry recognizes that clean power is both good for the environment and good for business. East Asian companies must step up to embrace that reality as well,” Lee added. Meanwhile, Netflix, which accounts for one-third of North America’s internet traffic and contributes to data demand worldwide, had announced in 2015 it planned to fully offset its carbon footprint. However, Greenpeace said that it’s likely that it’s turning to carbon offsets or unbundled renewable energy credits, which “do little” in terms of increasing the company’s renewable energy investment. “Like Apple, Facebook, and Google, Netflix is one of the biggest drivers of the online world and has a critical say in how it is powered. Netflix must embrace the responsibility to make sure its growth is powered by renewables, not fossil fuels and it must show its leadership here,” said Greenpeace USA Senior IT Analyst, Gary Cook, also in a statement. The company earned “F’s” in energy transparency, renewable energy commitment and advocacy. Amazon’s overall Clean Energy Index percentage fell from last year, thanks in part to its nearly doubling of its data center capacity in Virginia – a region with little to no renewable energy options, the organization said – which outstripped Amazon’s addition of renewable energy capacity. Amazon was also awarded an “F” for its energy transparency. “Amazon continues to talk a good game on renewables but is keeping its customers in the dark on its energy decisions. This is concerning, particularly as Amazon expands into markets served by dirty energy,” said Cook. However, Greenpeace did give it a nod for its increased clean energy and climate advocacy over the past year. Amazon’s advocacy with both policymakers and utility companies saw it supporting tax credits for clean energy, pushing for repeal of laws that restrict wind development, and negotiating an innovative energy management deal in Virginia, which saw the Dominion Virginia Power agreeing to integrate energy produced by Amazon’s wind and solar farm projects on the grid serving its AWS data centers. Greenpeace noted that nearly 20 internet companies have now committed to 100 percent renewable energy. But the fight isn’t over, as the sector itself continues to rapidly expand. “Thanks to the leadership and advocacy of companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Switch, we are seeing the tech industry make major strides toward powering the internet with clean energy,” said Cook. Update, 1/13/17: Following the release of the report, Greenpeace began a social campaign to raise awareness about those companies who received poor grades for their use of non-renewable energy. For example, the organization released the video below which targets Netflix:   \n",

            "Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday our daily guided tour of the biggest tech stories from the past 24 hours will appear here on TechCrunch.com. To get The Daily Crunch in your inbox every day of the week, sign up here. Atlassian says ‘hello’ to Trello,  Uber gets moving, and Facebook does more monetizing with video. All that and more in The Daily Crunch for January 9, 2017. 1. Atlassian buys Trello for $425 million Enterprise tech consolidation always seems to come with high price tags, and Atlassian’s acquisition of Trello is no exception. The owner of Hipchat picked up the project management SaaS tool for $425 million, of which $360 million is cash, today. Trello should help round out Atlassian’s productivity offerings, and give it a line on new customers for the rest of its suite. Trello can also probably ramp growth and product development under its new owner, so this should be good for everyone – as long as the cost of using Trello on its own doesn’t go up for customers.  2. Uber is giving away one of its key assets Uber  announced Movement, a new website that’ll open up access to its ride data in cities. The information will be anonymized, but it will reveal demand flow according to traffic zones already in use by regulators in municipalities. Of course, even though Uber’s giving out this data, it’s not giving away its algorithms for processing the info – and if it really leads to improved infrastructure, Uber’s bottom line should benefit. Still, it’s a semi-unselfish act from Uber, which is a bit of a novelty. 3. Facebook will test mid-roll ads Video on Facebook  has been good for publishers, but also hard to monetize. Now, Facebook is set to debut a mid-roll ad test with a 55 percent revenue split for publishers. It also sounds like it might encourage more quality over virality, which could be great for helping to clean up the more unsavory elements of media on FB right now. 4. In a world where the iPhone never existed… It’s the 10-year anniversary of the introduction of the iPhone, and John engages in some revisionist history to sketch out what life had been like if that seminal moment in technology history had never happened. Basically we sacrificed some choice in exchange for easy access to a huge range of services. Was it worth the trade? Probably. 5. A tale of two CESes Was CES underwhelming, or more relevant than ever at 50 years young? Depends on who you ask. Basically, the gadgeteers seem a bit underwhelmed, while people like me focused on mobility services and underlying technologies that span verticals felt like it was one of the most impactful shows in recent memory. 6. Netflix and Amazon won Golden Globes and HBO did not Jeff Bezos was in attendance as two of his shows won Golden Globes last night. The ecommerce player is officially Hollywood now – and a publisher and the biggest retailer on the planet and the leading voice assistant etc, etc. 7. Waymo just revealed a big competitive advantage Former self-driving Google car project Waymo has a big advantage over its competitors – it’s now making all its own hardware sensor. This is similar to how Apple wins by building its own processors and software for the iPhone. Huge for its drive to supply automakers with turn-key autonomous driving systems.  \n",

            "414 Facebook to test showing ads mid-video with publisher revenue split\n",
            "Facebook  is doing what many publishers had hoped it would one day do, according to Recode: opening up another key revenue stream for video producers. The so-called “mid-roll” ad unit, which inserts an advertiser’s clip in the middle of a video instead of up front or at the end, will enter testing soon according to the report, with revenue resulting from the ad sales split with publishers 55 percent in their favor. The Facebook mid-roll unit will be available after at least 20 seconds of viewing by a Facebook user, in videos that run 90 seconds or more, Recode says, and will probably change the way video views are tracked, since Facebook has classified a video view on its platform as any session in which a user watches a video for a minimum of three seconds. Monetizing videos on Facebook successfully will then rely a lot more on making longer videos, rather than focusing on putting as much into as short a span as possible in order to reach fickle, fast-scrolling Facebook news feed users. This could have a positive impact on another aspect of Facebook’s media business – it’s efforts to combat the proliferation of fake news stories on its platform. Encouraging more substance from video producers looking to use the platform to actually drive revenue could help put some pressure on quick turnaround content designed entirely to go viral with no focus on quality or substance.  \n",

            "415 Facebook hires Campbell Brown to forge media partnerships\n",
            "Facebook has tapped Campbell Brown, a former television news anchor and a charter school advocate, to lead its news partnerships team. Brown will be charged with easing tension between the media and Facebook, which have clashed over the social media giant’s role in disseminating the news, its censorship of news photos, and its proliferation of false and misleading stories. Brown announced her new role, fittingly, on Facebook — with a nod to rocky relationship between her new employer and her former coworkers in journalism. “This is a different role for me, but one where I will be tapping my newsroom experience to help news organizations and journalists work more closely and more effectively with Facebook,” she wrote. “Right now we are watching a massive transformation take place in the news business — both in the way people consume news and in the way reporters disseminate news. Facebook is a major part of this transformation.” Facebook said Brown would work on news partnerships but would not be taking on an editorial role or setting content policy for the company. As Facebook has faced backlash over censorship and fake news, some observers have called on the company to appoint a public editor who would explain the company’s opaque editorial decisions to its users, but that’s not the role Brown received. Instead, Brown will show media companies how to leverage Facebook in order to reach broader audiences and will receive feedback from publishers as the company creates new features for them. Facebook emphasized Brown’s experience running a news organization, pointing to her work on The 74, a publication focused on education. Brown previously worked as an anchor on CNN. More recently, she’s campaigned for charter schools and against tenure for teachers. Facebook also stressed that it’s too early for speculation about what Brown will do, but we have a few guesses. Given her background in television and Facebook’s recent push to get users more engaged with its Live video streaming feature, it’s possible that we’ll see Facebook nudging publishers toward Live. Brown is also likely to have a hand in Facebook’s Instant Articles, the platform Facebook offers to publications that hosts their content and allows it load faster in News Feed. News outlets have squirmed over allowing Facebook to control their articles in this format and Facebook has recently admitted several mistakes in Instant Articles metrics, impacting publications’ ability to measure their web traffic.

            "Nvidia  is giving gamers using the GeForce Experience will now be able to broadcast directly to Facebook Live, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang announced at CES today. Huang basically breezed past the announcement heading into a trailer for Mass Effect: Andromeda streamed live, but it does represent a rather huge development in live streaming. While Twitch has largely become the go-to place to watch streamed games, Facebook has increasingly tried to creep into that space. And for good reason. Huang said Twitch has streamed more than two trillion minutes, and if Facebook can snap up that kind of engagement, it’s going to give Facebook yet another big foothold in the increasingly hot live streaming space. Of course, this requires that users exist within the Nvidia GeForce Experience universe. But Nvidia’s sell is that it can optimize your computer and gaming experience and simplify the process of making the games play best. By playing games within the GeForce Experience, users will be able to connect it directly “with two clicks,” Huang said on stage. It’ll allow users to capture more and more gaming footage, which has also become a big area where startups like Forge are popping up. And if it offers live-streamers another place to gather a big audience, it’s going to continue to make Nvidia increasingly the go-to platform. (As a side note, Mass Effect: Andromeda is coming out March 21, according to what they said on stage.)   \n",

            "417 Facebook adds automatic subtitling for Page videos\n",
            "Facebook  pulled the world back into the silent film era with its muted, auto-play videos, but its latest tool could make it easier to repurpose traditional clips. Facebook has launched a free, automatic video captioning tool to all US English Facebook Pages. TechCrunch and some other Pages only recently began seeing the quietly launched option, though Facebook responded to our inquiry saying it began rolling out the feature in October. Powered by voice recognition software, it takes the hassle out of transcription while making it easy to edit the subtitles it suggests. That’s critical since our early tests showed frequent transcription errors. This is somewhat expected considering the tool is free and operated entirely by computers. And with time as Page admins manually enter corrections, Facebook’s system will surely improve.   Facebook launched auto-play video at the end of 2013. We predicted it would force video producers to create clips that make sense even with the sound off. Manually adding subtitles was the best way to do that for a few years. Facebook first rolled out auto-captioning for video ads in February 2016, in an attempt to make its advertising channel more competitive with platforms like YouTube that always play clips with the sound on. The feature could potentially expand to user-uploaded videos but Facebook refused to comment on future plans. For now, Facebook wants to help every Page adapt to the silent-until-clicked auto-play format. That way, users in public without headphones can fully understand videos they watch muted, and viewers can make a better assessment in the first silent seconds about whether they want to watch full-screen with sound. When Page admins upload a video, they’ll see a “Generate” button in the video editor to instantly add subtitles, or they’ll see the “Generate” button above the video in the feed. Facebook breaks down the subtitles snippet by snippet, allowing you to review the suggestion, play back that segment to hear it for yourself, and edit the captions for accuracy before saving them to the video. Auto-play for non-advertisers could attract more semi-professional and pro video “creators” who seek to build fan bases on Facebook’s massive platform. Facebook and Instagram have increasingly pushed to lure these content-makers away from competitors like YouTube, Snapchat, and the now-defunct Vine. YouTube also offers machine learning-powered auto captioning.  Facebook expects to hit News Feed ad saturation soon, which means it will need to boost revenue by earning more per ad instead of just showing more ads. That’s why video is so important. Getting more Pages sharing more watchable videos normalizes the content type in the feed so Facebook can slip in additional lucrative videos ads around them. And when people finish watching one clip, Facebook suggests they watch others that can include video ads. Video may be the future of Facebook, but having tinny sound blaring out of your phone doesn’t always fit with our lives. Captions allow us to consume even when we need to be quiet.  \n",

            "Asian Snapchat clone Snow caught the attention of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who tried unsuccessfully to buy it last year, and it is continuing to grow steadily. The app’s Korean parent Naver today confirmed it crossed 100 million downloads in December, with 40-50 percent of its user base active on the app each month. Those are pretty impressive figures for a one-year-old project, but still some way behind Snapchat (the U.S. company, tipped to go public in a $4 billion IPO, has 150 million daily active users). Snow has targeted very different geographies to its rival, though. China is the largest market in terms of users, with Japan and Korea following respectively, although the company did not disclose raw figures for its user base in these countries. Those official figures are on par with data we reported from October, when a source told us that Snow had surpassed 80 million downloads and was adding 10 million per month. Back in July, The New York Times reported that the app was at around 30 million downloads.  App Annie data shows Snow’s popularity in Japan, Korea and Hong Kong (China figures unavailable) Like many other Western services, Snapchat is blocked in China. Snow, which mimics the U.S.-based app but with many more options for face filters and stickers, has stepped up to fill the gap in some ways, but it is still just scratching surface. The Chinese government estimates there are more than 700 million internet users in the country, so even the most optimistic figures for Snow in China — say, for example, that half of those 100 million downloads are from the country — would represent a mere drop in the ocean. But, there’s doubtless potential there. Naver  saw fit to reject Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s advances because it believes it has a hit on its hands. Chat app LINE, Naver’s biggest success to date, raised more than $1 billion in a dual Japan-U.S. IPO in July, and the firm sees similar possibilities for Snow. Indeed, Naver strengthened ties between the two services in September when LINE made a $45 million investment in Snow at a $180 million valuation. You’d suspect that latter figure has gone up a few notches in the months that have passed.  Three of the many filters available on Snow  \n",
